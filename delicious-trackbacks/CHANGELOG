0.3 (17th Mar 2008)
-------------------
* Don't attempt to send trackbacks if we mark the bookmark as private: If the bookmark is private then the permalink that we send as part of the trackback won't be resolvable (at least I don't think it is!)
* Send the blog_name (currently 'del.icio.us bookmarks for USERNAME') as part of the trackback.

0.2 (4th Mar 2008)
-------------------
* Record the success/failure of sending a trackback - this relies on some crappy regex parsing of the response we get from the trackback service and that we send the trackback request synchronously.
* Only send a trackback once per bookmark (by checking for the dtb-sent tag).
