== For P.O.C ==
* Get logged in username so that I can construct the del.icio.us permalink

== To get to a compiled state ==
* Populate trackback text with trackback url
* Remove trackback textfield and the option to send (i.e. always send).

== Nice to have ==
* yDebug debugging statements
* Preferences for default 'send trackback'
* Add pingback support
* Tidy up xul display
* Support for multiple trackback urls?? (could/would this ever happen?)
* Support for user-entered trackback url

== Permalinks Project ==
* Add urlTag to post object
* Add permalink to post object (which is full url, including username)
