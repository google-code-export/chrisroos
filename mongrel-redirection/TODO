* Web Interface
* Export rules
* Backup rule files
* Daemonize Mongrel properly
* Specify the redirection status code in the rules
* Append .conf to rule filenames so that I can place an invalid_domain_name.co.uk.conf.sample example ruleset in there and still svn ignore all the others.
* Sort the directory structure out
* 404 page if redirection not found
* Docs - suggest using, for example, url.example.com and www.url.example.com
