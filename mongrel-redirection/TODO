* Web Interface
* Export rules
* Backup rule files
* Daemonize Mongrel properly
* Specify the redirection status code in the rules
* Append .conf to rule filenames so that I can place an invalid_domain_name.co.uk.conf.sample example ruleset in there and still svn ignore all the others.
* Sort the directory structure out
* 404 page if redirection not found
* Docs - suggest using, for example, url.example.com and www.url.example.com


* PUT <redirection-xml> to url (e.g. chrisroos.co.uk/amazon-wishlist) 
** e.g. <redirection><to>http://example.com</to><status>302</status></redirection>
** Will require some authentication
* GET /
** With authentication = list of redirections
** Without authentication, either redirect (if necessary rule is specified) or 404
* Build simple AJAX client / Desktop widget to control redirections

*** Future: POST redirection to create tiny-url type redirect where you don't care what URL you get
