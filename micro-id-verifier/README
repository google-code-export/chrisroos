Very Simple Micro Id Verifier
-----------------------------

== Synopsis ==
This is, essentially, a straight port of Fred Stutzman's[1] (perl) micro_id verifier[2], written in Ruby[3].

The basic component is a Link.  A Link comprises a url, expected micro_id and status.  When we send a link the verify_micro_id! message; it attempts to grab the html for the page at <url> and compare the <expected_micro_id> with a micro_id (if found) on that page.  The <status> for a link is updated according to the outcome of this process.

To process all unverified links in the database, use Link::verify_all

== Link status values ==
Unprocessed = 1
Verification Success = 2
Verification Failure = 3
Verification Error = 4

== Pre-requisites ==
Ruby 1.8.4 (will probably work with previous versions but I haven't tried)
Rubygems [4]
ActiveRecord [5]
RubyfulSoup [6]
Database compatible with ActiveRecord (tested with MySql)

== Optional ==
Rake [7] (to run tests)

== Setup database ==
Configure config/database.yml and create the database and table.  Table structure (for mysql) is in config/database.mysql.sql.

== Run tests ==
# rake

== Run example webserver and perform simple verifications against it ==
# rake webserver_example
