%h1 The Local Paper
%p.notice I'm removing this site because I don't think it's adding any value to the web.
%p The original intention (and one that I might return to) was to provide a permalink for each story in my local papers.  I wanted it to be easy for people to discuss the stories in the local papers.  I think some or all of the online versions of my local papers now have commenting enabled.
%p There's a little more info on the background of the project on <a href="http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2007-06-01-an-open-letter-to-my-local-newspapers">my blog</a>.
