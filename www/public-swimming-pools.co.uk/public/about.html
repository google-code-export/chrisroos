    <h1><a href="/">Home</a> - About the Public Swimming Pools (in the UK) project</h1>
    
    <p>This started out of the frustrating experience I had trying to find public swimming pools in London: I tried, and failed, on multiple occasions to find swimming pools in different parts of London.</p>
    
    <p>I've started by adding the four swimming pools that I've used most often, with a view to adding more in the, near, future.</p>
    
    <p>Feel free to join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/public-swimming-pools">public pools google group</a> if you have any questions, pools you want added or maybe just a chat.</p>
