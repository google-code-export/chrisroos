    <h1>Public swimming pools</h1>
    <p class="notice">I'm removing this placeholder site because I don't think it's adding any value to the web.</p>
    <p>The intention was, and kinda still is, to create a site all about publicly accessible swimming pools (i.e. those that don't require you to be a member to use).  I was driven to start the project by the lack of a similar site that would serve my needs (there is <a href="http://activeplaces.co.uk">activeplaces</a> but that's one of the least useful sites I've ever come across).</p>
    <p>If you're in any way interested in this project then you might be interested in the <a href="http://rewiredstate.org">rewiredstate</a> <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/projects/active-places-reloaded">active places reloaded</a> hack that I participated in.</p>
