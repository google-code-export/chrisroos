* Remove unused css/images

* Print css

* Make the article titles h1

* Move .css files from public/ to public/stylesheets

* Host yui.css locally to avoid any latency issues

* Use javascript syntax highlighter in place of current syntax gem thingy

* consider xhtml instead of html 4?

* add a contact page

* Add number of comments to bottom of posts when in 'list' view, i.e. when shown as part of a tag (or on homepage etc)

* IDEA - add a little description to each post that i can use when displaying a long list of articles (e.g. /articles/2007)

* Add meta description

* Employ compression for html pages

* Feed icon needs to be copied over from typo r1219

* Permanently redirect latest articles rss feed to atom feed - does that mean I can get rid of guids?

* Move site-generation to app

* Store articles as Atom entries (to allow easy storage of metadata)
