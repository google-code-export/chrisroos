* Remove unused css/images

* Print css

* Make the article titles h1

* Move .css files from public/ to public/stylesheets

* Host yui.css locally to avoid any latency issues

* Use javascript syntax highlighter in place of current syntax gem thingy

* consider xhtml instead of html 4?

* del.icio.us javacsript badge

* flickr javascript badge

* twitter javascript badge

* add a contact page

* Add number of comments to bottom of posts when in 'list' view, i.e. when shown as part of a tag (or on homepage etc)

* IDEA - add a little description to each description that i can use when displaying a long list of articles (e.g. /articles/2007)

* Add meta description

* The use of fn1 breaks xhtml (multiple ids with same value) when multiple articles are shown on one page

* What to do for the main articles resource?  i can't sensibly display all articles so i guess i'll need to add some paging.  unless the main articles resource only shows the last X posts.  You must then navigate/search for any older posts.
** Or, maybe I can display all posts if only a snippet is shown..
** Or, a contents page with a list of all articles
*** I think that any request for a paged articles/ resource should go to a contents page.

* Employ compression for html pages

* Feed icon needs to be copied over from typo r1219

* Permanently redirect latest articles rss feed to atom feed - does that mean I can get rid of guids?

* Move site-generation to app

* A tag 'index page' (that can't be called index because we actually have a tag called index...) that lists all tags.

* Monthly archives in right hand nav

* Store articles as Atom entries (to allow easy storage of metadata)

* Add tags to sitemap??? (One idea is to tag each of my pages in del.icio.us and redirect requests for my tags over there)

* Run each comment/trackback through akismet and see if any of the unpublished ones come up as potential ham
