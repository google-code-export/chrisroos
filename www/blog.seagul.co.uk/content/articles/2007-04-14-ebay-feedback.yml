:title: ebay feedback
:body: |-
  This is a pathetic moan about something that is really not important at all.
  
  I bought an "Apple mini DVI to VGA adapter":http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ih=014&sspagename=STRK%3AMEWN%3AIT&viewitem=&item=330105019114&rd=1&rd=1 from someone on "ebay":http://www.ebay.co.uk.  For various reasons, I was unable to test the adapter until yesterday (Fri 13th Apr), two weeks after the purchase.  That didn't stop the seller emailing me a week ago, suggesting that I leave feedback before they do.  That's pathetic - feedback should be left for me based on the speed of my purchase alone, which was immediate.  What the seller is actually saying in that email is that if I decide to leave them bad feedback then they'll probably do the same to me out of retaliation.  Grow up eh.
  
  The adapter actually works great, and I've now left the seller positive feedback.

    What's the point in feedback then? The feedback should be completely independant of each other.
    
    He should've left feedback as soon as he received your payment. That is as much input he needs from you.
    
    If he did get a negative comment from you then there is a chance for him to put his case forward, not to retaliate with a negative comment.

    Because feedback is so important to E-bay users (both selling and buying), they want to make sure if anyone has had any bad experience that they can put in their oar...
    
    "Oh yes, I was 3 weeks late with that delivery and the guy complained, but he didn't give me his address for 2 weeks and he was an asshole!"
    
    I always feel a little bit put out of they don't leave feedback for me, but not enough to contact them or withhold my own feedback!

    Isn't the solution for eBay to allow multiple feedback for a single transaction? For example, if a sale goes through smoothly, but the product falls apart a week later because it's shoddy, I can't leave feedback if I've already said that the transaction was satisfactory.
    
    As the system currently is, feedback is a scarce commodity that ends up being traded quid pro quo - but that scarcity is entirely artificial. And I still don't know whether the stuff people are selling is any good - just that they are good at selling it.
