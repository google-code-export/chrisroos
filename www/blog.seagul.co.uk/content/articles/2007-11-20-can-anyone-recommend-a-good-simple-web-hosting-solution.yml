:title: Can anyone recommend a good simple web hosting solution?
:body: I'm keen to move some domains over to "google apps":http://www.google.com/a but I need more than the included Page Creator.  Ideally, I want a very basic, reliable webhost that allows me to host static files.  Anyone have any recommendations?
