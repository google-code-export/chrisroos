:title: The worst word in the world... ever
:body: I don't know why, but I really don't like the word 'texted'.  It hurts my ears when I hear it, and my eyes when I see it.

  :body: m*nd*tory. It's a bully boy word. If something is "m*nd*tory" it means you WILL do it because you have no choice. And "obl*g*tory" is another one almost as bad.
