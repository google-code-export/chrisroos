:title: A new reevoo.com
:body: |-
  This is obviously completely optional but if anyone stumbles across this post, I'd really appreciate it if you'd spend a few minutes checking out the revised "reevoo.com":http://www.reevoo.com.
  
  I don't want to say too much as I want to influence any judgement.  Just check it out and let me know what you think, either in the comments here or by "email":mailto:chrisroos@reevoo.com.  Oh, and really don't be scared to slag it off, praise it up or just sit on the fence - any opinion is welcome.
  
  Oh, and in case it's not obvious, I work at Reevoo.

    On the face of it, I rather like it. I can't compare it to the old version because, I'm afraid, I never saw it.
    
    Specific bits (well, you did say!):
    
    I really like the map and the location of the geolocated-comment-speech-bubble thingies. Debbie from Whitstable looked like she was commenting from Dartford though, certainly the bubble was not emanating from anywhere near Thanet. (Of course, only a nit-picking local would notice)
    
    I liked watching the review quotes flash up - I can imagine people just staying around to watch them. I really hated the spelling errors in the quotes, though. But I pick those nits too.
    
    I went for a look at some reviews for a specific product (the "Canon 4000 SLR", which would more correctly be described by its real name, "Canon EOS 400D" - quality control?) and I'm baffled how it can score 9/10 yet be "average" in every respect. Ah, I went to "what does this mean" and I understand it now. Maybe it could be clearer on the page?
    
    Look and feel seems pretty intuitive, which is nice. Here's a funny little thing though - when I wanted to switch back to the site to look at something, I had a moment of trouble finding the tab in Firefox. I realised that there were two contributing factors: 
    * first, I was on the FAQ, so the tab caption was "Frequently Ask..."
    * second, the icon was the blue-quotes thingy
    
    On the favicon idea, I was looking for something orange, which suggests that I immediately assigned mentally the white "revoo" on an orange background as the logo - I think I might have spotted a white "r" in an orange circle more easily.
    
    But I'm a nit-picky geek[1] with time in his hands while I wait for my database server to stop being broken.
    
    fn1. How much of a geek? I just noticed that this box takes Textile, so I had to go back and add a pretty unnecessary list, just because I could. Oh, and a footnote.

    Excellent feedback thanks Mike.  Let's see if we can work on some of the stuff you've raised.
    
    Cheers.

  :body: I like it!  Although the constantly updating map quickly became distracting as I looked at the rest of the home page.  Perhaps it could stop after a few reviews with a link over the map saying "see more" or you could add a button to stop it...

    Hey Doug,
    
    Thanks for the feedback.  I've personally not found the map distracting - but then I'm not often on the homepage so my views probably shouldn't count :-).  One oversight, in my view, is that it currently takes at least two clicks to get from the homepage to any reviews.  In fact, I might try to sort that today.
    
    Cheers.

    One very quick initial comment is that on the homepage the reviews that pop-up need to have a link to the associated product page. The actual product review pages are clearer now, I had to laugh at one reviewer's negative points regarding the Canon EOS 400D...

  :body: One more point; using light-blue text on the site makes it hard to distinguish where there are hyper-links (darker-blue text). This is especially noticeable on the FAQ page.

    Hey Ben,
    
    I completely agree that the reviews need to link through to the product review pages.  Although it's very unlikely to be of a product you're interested in, it would allow people to get a feel for the product pages immediately.
    
    As for the links, I see your point too.  The grey visited-link colour isn't particular clear either.  Some work to do there I think.
    
    Cheers
