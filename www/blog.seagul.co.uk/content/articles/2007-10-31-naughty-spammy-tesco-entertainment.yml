:title: Naughty spammy Tesco Entertainment
:body: "Are Tesco Entertainment the new \"Orange\":http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/03/16/orange-orange-orange?  They might just be you know.  See, I've been sad and pathetic enough to \"record\":http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions details of unwanted emails that I receive.  So far \"Tesco Entertainment\":http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment, bless 'em, have been unable to remove me from their mailing list for 90 days.  I thought I'd write them a little email to, you know, ask them to stop spamming me.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  <blockquote>\r\n\
  Here's a list of emails you've sent me.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  * Received: 26-Jun-2007\r\n\
  * Received: 11-Jul-2007\r\n\
  * Received: 27-Jul-2007\r\n\
  * *Unsubscribed*: 30-Jul-2007 (although it appeared that I wasn\xE2\x80\x99t actually signed up to any offers\xE2\x80\xA6)\r\n\
  * Received: 08-Aug-2007\r\n\
  * Received: 21-Aug-2007\r\n\
  * Received: 16-Oct-2007\r\n\
  * I emailed you on 17th Oct:\r\n\
  \xE2\x80\x9CI unsubscribed from you guys on the 30th July 2007 (interestingly, my preferences suggested that I wasn\xE2\x80\x99t actually subscribed to any mailings in the first place). Since then, you\xE2\x80\x99ve sent me Tesco Entertainment emails on the 8th Aug, 21st Aug and 16th Oct1. Please stop.  Cheers,  Chris  [1] http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\

  You'll notice that I've received four emails since unsubscribing on the 30th July.  I think three months is long enough to remove someone from your spam list isn't it?  Oh, and you'll also see I've emailed you in the past too.  It wouldn't hurt to reply would it?\r\n\
  \r\n\
  Cheers,\r\n\

  I received a reply from Tesco.\r\n\
  \r\n\
  <blockquote>\r\n\

  This phrase made me smile, \"Thank you for telling us about this and giving us the chance to put things right.\"."
