  Ah, a seetickets.com email has fallen into my spam bucket.  I don't really read them anyway, I might as well unsubscribe.  Not so fast though it seems...
  
  First of all, what's the deal with the email confirmation box?

  Oh well, might as well fill it in and submit.  But wait.  What's this?

  Wow, an email server that takes upto 60 seconds to:
  
  <div class="code"><pre><code class="sql">
  DELETE FROM newsletters WHERE email = 'MY_EMAIL';
  </code></pre></div>
  
  Oh well, I best click OK and wait.  Oh.
