  Tuttety tut tut tut.  I unsubscribed from you guys, don't you "remember":http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/01/12/move-over-seetickets-com-youve-got-nothing-on-orange-co-uk?  Obviously not, as you've just emailed me again.  Oh well, might as well hit that unsubscribe link one more time...

    Watchdog just slagged off Orange broadband, one of the major complaints was the difficulty in unsubscribing; sound familiar?
