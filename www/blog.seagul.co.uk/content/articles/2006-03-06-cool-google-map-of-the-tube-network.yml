  :body: "Really cool - but is it *useful*? You can also get the tube map for mp3 players here: <a href='http://www.ipodsubwaymaps.com/download.php#london'>http://www.ipodsubwaymaps.com/download.php#london</a> (the site mentions only iPods but it works fine on my iRiver). "

  :body: Looks very cool and it's got a route planner too.  It must be using the google maps API, there's an article on this on development works too <a href='http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/db2/library/techarticle/dm-0602lurie/'>http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/db2/library/techarticle/dm-0602lurie/</a>
