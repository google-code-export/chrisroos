:message: <p>Hey James,</p><p>I&#8217;d love to help with an implementation for the Halifax but I don&#8217;t have an account with them I&#8217;m afraid.</p><p>I agree about the long term viability of this approach.  It&#8217;d be great if just one of the banks understood this stuff and started offering secure rss/atom feeds of transactions.  Then, logging in would only be required when you wanted to do something important, like moving money between account and making payments.</p>
