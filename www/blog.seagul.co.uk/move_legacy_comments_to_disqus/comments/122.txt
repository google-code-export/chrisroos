:message: "<p>You can name your tests to better express intention, and it&#8217;s best to keep documentation of intentions as close to where you&#8217;re tempted to change things as possible.</p><p>What do you think about naming tests along the lines of: &#8220;all attributes used to make up the url should be required&#8221; and &#8220;should allow articles to be created without author&#8221;.</p><p>Does that help any?</p><p>On another level, you might suggest that there&#8217;s a level of abstraction/modelling missing in the code. You want to validate that fields required for the url are complete, and somewhere declare what fields are required for the url. The routes is one declaration, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily map from attributes of a model to parts of a route. Hmm.</p>"
