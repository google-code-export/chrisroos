:message: <p>Isn&#8217;t the solution for eBay to allow multiple feedback for a single transaction? For example, if a sale goes through smoothly, but the product falls apart a week later because it&#8217;s shoddy, I can&#8217;t leave feedback if I&#8217;ve already said that the transaction was satisfactory.</p><p>As the system currently is, feedback is a scarce commodity that ends up being traded quid pro quo &#8211; but that scarcity is entirely artificial. And I still don&#8217;t know whether the stuff people are selling is any good &#8211; just that they are good at selling it.</p>
