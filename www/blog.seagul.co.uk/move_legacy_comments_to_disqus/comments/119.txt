  <p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll get the change to post some of our discussion to interblah.net soon :)</p>
  
  
  	<p>Incidentally, you might want to investigate using Git as your source control system; since that allows operation without connection to any remote server, you&#8217;d be able to make smaller commits with more detailed information about the &#8220;why&#8221;s. Using git-svn, you can even push those changes back up to an SVN server for consumption by the masses.</p>
  
  
  	<p>That said, it&#8217;s taken me a few weeks to get my head around the conceptual differences between git and SVN &#8211; it&#8217;s not for everyone, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
