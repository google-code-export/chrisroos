:message: <p>One very quick initial comment is that on the homepage the reviews that pop-up need to have a link to the associated product page. The actual product review pages are clearer now, I had to laugh at one reviewer&#8217;s negative points regarding the Canon EOS 400D&#8230;</p><p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s not possible to crop pictures on the lcd and then to save them. Quite a drawback if you don&#8217;t have the time to fiddle around on the computer.&#8221;</em></p>
