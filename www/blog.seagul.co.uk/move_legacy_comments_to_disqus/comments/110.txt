  <p>On the face of it, I rather like it. I can&#8217;t compare it to the old version because, I&#8217;m afraid, I never saw it.</p>
  
  
  	<p>Specific bits (well, you did say!):</p>
  
  
  	<p>I really like the map and the location of the geolocated-comment-speech-bubble thingies. Debbie from Whitstable looked like she was commenting from Dartford though, certainly the bubble was not emanating from anywhere near Thanet. (Of course, only a nit-picking local would notice)</p>
  
  
  	<p>I liked watching the review quotes flash up &#8211; I can imagine people just staying around to watch them. I really hated the spelling errors in the quotes, though. But I pick those nits too.</p>
  
  
  	<p>I went for a look at some reviews for a specific product (the &#8220;Canon 4000 <span class="caps">SLR</span>&#8221;, which would more correctly be described by its real name, &#8220;Canon <span class="caps">EOS 400D</span>&#8221; &#8211; quality control?) and I&#8217;m baffled how it can score 9/10 yet be &#8220;average&#8221; in every respect. Ah, I went to &#8220;what does this mean&#8221; and I understand it now. Maybe it could be clearer on the page?</p>
  
  
  Look and feel seems pretty intuitive, which is nice. Here&#8217;s a funny little thing though &#8211; when I wanted to switch back to the site to look at something, I had a moment of trouble finding the tab in Firefox. I realised that there were two contributing factors: 
  	<ul>
  	<li>first, I was on the <span class="caps">FAQ</span>, so the tab caption was &#8220;Frequently Ask&#8230;&#8221; </li>
  		<li>second, the icon was the blue-quotes thingy</li>
  	</ul>
  
  
  	<p>On the favicon idea, I was looking for something orange, which suggests that I immediately assigned mentally the white &#8220;revoo&#8221; on an orange background as the logo &#8211; I think I might have spotted a white &#8220;r&#8221; in an orange circle more easily.</p>
  
  
  	<p>But I&#8217;m a nit-picky geek<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> with time in his hands while I wait for my database server to stop being broken.</p>
  
  
  	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> How much of a geek? I just noticed that this box takes Textile, so I had to go back and add a pretty unnecessary list, just because I could. Oh, and a footnote.</p>
