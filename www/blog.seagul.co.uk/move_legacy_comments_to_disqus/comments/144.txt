  <p>The thing about mod rewrite is that it is voodoo, damn cool voodoo but voodoo nevertheless (some one more impressive than me said that ages ago but I&#8217;m to lazy to look up the actual quote).</p><p>I had a similar situation when I moved a wiki from a sub directory to a sub domain.  The sub domain required that the folder of the SD be in the ht root.  Common cPanel hackishness.  So all requests for lordmatt.co.uk/wiki and wiki.lordmatt.co.uk were exactly the same.</p><p>I came up with:</p><pre>RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^wiki\.lordmatt\.co\.uk(.*)$ [NC]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wiki/ [NC]
  RewriteRule ^wiki(.*)$  http://wiki.lordmatt.co.uk$1 [R=301,NC,L]</pre><p>The problem I had was similar in that if I redirected for the &#8220;wrong&#8221; urls then the internal requests looped forever.  The result is http code 500 &#8211; internal server error.</p><p>As you can gather there is more than one way to get something to work.  As with all voodoo that it works is important and a congratulations is awarded to anyone able to brew up a solution to a problem.</p>
