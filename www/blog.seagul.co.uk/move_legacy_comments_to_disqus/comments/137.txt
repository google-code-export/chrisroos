  <p>It wouldn&#8217;t be too hard to make hyphenation optional, and to redirect to the canonical version.</p>
  
  
  	<p>The <span class="caps">BBC</span> do something clever with their URLs, actually: many of them are communicated by being read out over the air, so they are short and sweet and handle ambiguity: http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/ is canonical; http://www.bbc.co.uk/radiofour/ redirects to radio4. (And of course, http, www, and trailing slashes are dealt with higher up the application stack.)</p>
  
  
  	<p>They don&#8217;t handle hyphens, however. Maybe they should.</p>
