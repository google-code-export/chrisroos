  <p>The plist file can be either plain text or XML (maybe binary too); these instructions only work if the file is plain text or if it doesn&#8217;t exist yet. In my case, I already had an XML format file in that location.</p>
  
  
  	<p>If it does exist, you can either edit it by hand or open it in the property list editor instead (type &#8216;open ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist&#8217; in the console) and add a String key called &#8216;PATH&#8217; under Root.</p>
