  <p>Hey Doug,</p>
  
  
  	<p>Thanks for the feedback.  I&#8217;ve personally not found the map distracting &#8211; but then I&#8217;m not often on the homepage so my views probably shouldn&#8217;t count :-).  One oversight, in my view, is that it currently takes at least two clicks to get from the homepage to any reviews.  In fact, I might try to sort that today.</p>
  
  
  	<p>Cheers.</p>
