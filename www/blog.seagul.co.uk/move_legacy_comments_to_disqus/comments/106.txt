:message: <p>@Chris Goward.  It&#8217;s not the money.  It&#8217;s the fact that it took me from Wednesday last week until Monday this week to get any impressions registered against my experiment.  If they&#8217;d said up front that I&#8217;d need to pay a fiver then I&#8217;d have done it and could have made progress on the same day.</p>
