  <p>Because feedback is so important to E-bay users (both selling and buying), they want to make sure if anyone has had any bad experience that they can put in their oar&#8230;</p>
  
  
  	<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I was 3 weeks late with that delivery and the guy complained, but he didn&#8217;t give me his address for 2 weeks and he was an asshole!&#8221;</p>
  
  
  	<p>I always feel a little bit put out of they don&#8217;t leave feedback for me, but not enough to contact them or withhold my own feedback!</p>
