  <p>Lordy, the idea that any consultant that HSBC would ever hire would ever recommend open-source is, I dunno, a bit freaky. And I write from having been a consultant in the past, dealing in part with retail banking operations. If you worked for Accenture (to risk unfairly badmouthing what in reality may be a very forward-thinking company) then you&#8217;d be a much better corporate servant if you recommended that your comapny be retained to build an in-house alternative. What&#8217;s best for the consultants is not necessarily best for the client.</p><p>I could be wrong, but I think you&#8217;d be likely to find that the kind of individual working on t&#8217;Internet apps at a retail bank such as HSBC is going to be someone who has been retrained from IBM mainframe COBOL and isn&#8217;t happy about it. In fact, they probably resent the heck out of the whole t&#8217;Internet[1] thing.</p><p>And I can&#8217;t even begin to speculate how awful senior IT management in such a place must be. I suppose I could ask my brother, who deals with them at Lloyds TSB.</p><p>Golly, I&#8217;m a cynical, Grumpy Old Man.</p><p>It&#8217;s not all gloom, though &#8211; my place (a German bank whose name sort of means &#8220;German&#8221; in German) has just made Rails available as an option for intranet sites. So I can now get paid to work in Ruby. Which must be progress.</p><p>[1] Sorry, I&#8217;ve been reading a Peter Kay book recently.</p>
