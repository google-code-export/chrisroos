  <p>Hi Chris,</p>
  
  
  	<p>I&#8217;m finally getting around to trying out your code to convert my egg statements. I&#8217;ve checked out the svn code and created the statements and ofx output folders (basically put them in with the code to make things easier, didn&#8217;t alter the defaults). I&#8217;ve also installed the hpricot gem with: sudo gem install hpricot</p>
  
  
  	<p>When I run the ruby code egg.rb I get the following error:</p>
  
  
  <code>tanc$ ruby egg.rb</code>
  <br/>
  <code>./lib/ofx.rb:2:in `require': no such file to load -- builder (LoadError)
          from ./lib/ofx.rb:2
          from egg.rb:2</code>
  
  	<p><br/>Can you guide me on what is going wrong? I&#8217;d love to get this working. Feel free to email me.</p>
  
  
  	<p>Thanks.</p>
