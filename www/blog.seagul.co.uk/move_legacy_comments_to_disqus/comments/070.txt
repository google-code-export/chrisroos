  <p>Hey Chris,</p><p>Thanks for the code but I can&#8217;t get it working. It doesn&#8217;t seem to generate a valid OFX file for me, by which I mean it actually looks like valid OFX (as far as I can tell) but doesn&#8217;t seem to upload to Wesabe nor validate with the Money OFX Data Analyzer that I found.</p><p>I&#8217;ve got the latest code from your google repository. Any ideas?</p><p>Cheers,
  Marc</p>
