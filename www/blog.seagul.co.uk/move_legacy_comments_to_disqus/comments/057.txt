  <p>Chris,</p>
  
  
  	<p>We&#8217;ve run into similar concerns re. association proxies and object hopping. I wrote a plugin that adds methods that wrap the common find, build and count association proxy methods. You could add &#8216;add&#8217; to this easily.</p>

  	<p>We&#8217;ve also become fans of Forwardable&#8217;s def_delegator and def_delegators (roughly the same as Rails&#8217; delegate method, if you want). Using David&#8217;s example:</p>
  
  
  	<p>class Stories &lt; AR:B
    extend Forwardable
    def_delegator :iterations, :stories
  end</p>
