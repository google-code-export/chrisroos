:message: <p>Just found <a href="http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/news/2007/07july/070706buy.shtml">this</a> out on the local blogger circuit.</p><p>The Trinity group has been bought out and apparently the new owners run the Daily Mail too. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll add some &#8216;class&#8217; to the local rags. I wonder how many Diana stories they&#8217;ll get in there!</p>
