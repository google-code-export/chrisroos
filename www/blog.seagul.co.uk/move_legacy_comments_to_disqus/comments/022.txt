:message: "<p>I added this to the Rails bundle included with TextMate, hopefully you won\xE2\x80\x99t mind :)</p><p>I gave it a key equivalent of \xE2\x8C\x83\xE2\x87\xA7\xE2\x8C\x98S (a little convoluted, but presumably this isn\xE2\x80\x99t a frequent action) and placed it in the Model submenu. I also added a progress indicator since it took ~1.5s for me for the tool tip to show.</p>"
