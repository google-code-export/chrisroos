  <p>Hi Chris,</p>
  
  
  	<p>I&#8217;m Ed, one of the founders of Nestoria.</p>
  
  
  	<p>Many thanks for the kind words, we like to think we&#8217;re not crap either ;-).</p>
  
  
  	<p>That being said, we know we still have a lot to do to make searching for property as simple as possible. Any ideas you (or your readers) have are very welcome.</p>
  
  
  	<p>In that sense, from your blog I see that you&#8217;re a Ruby coder. I don&#8217;t suppose I could persuade you to write a Ruby library for using the Nestoria API? We recently had someone create a python library:</p>
  
  
  	<p><a href="http://blog.nestoria.co.uk/2006/09/21/python-library-for-the-nestoria-api/">http://blog.nestoria.co.uk/2006/09/21/python-library-for-the-nestoria-api/</a></p>
  
  
  	<p>and we&#8217;d love to see what clever ideas the Ruby community could come up with for playing with our database.</p>
  
  
  	<p>Thanks again for the vote of confidence,</p>
  
  
  	<p>Ed</p>
