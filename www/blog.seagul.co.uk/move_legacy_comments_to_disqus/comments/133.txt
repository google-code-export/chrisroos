  <p>Hi Chris,</p>
  
  
  	<p>In regard to the issue about being charged or not, linked to whether the web address starts with www. or not, the answer is as you suspected &#8211; charges will be incurred.</p>
  
  
  	<p>The problem with m.twitter.com not showing the message has now been resolved.</p>
  
  
  	<p>Hope this helps,</p>
  
  
  	<p>Sam.
