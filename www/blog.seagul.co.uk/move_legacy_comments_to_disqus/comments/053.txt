:message: <p>Hi Jamis,</p><p>I think the problem is that we&#8217;re asking a person for their hobbies object in order to manipulate it directly.  What we really want to do is tell the person to add their own hobby &#8211; we don&#8217;t care how they go about it.</p><p>Apologies for the short answer &#8211; I was trying to expand upon it with examples but found myself rambling a little too much.  Maybe I&#8217;ll try a follow-up post with more exploration of the issue.</p>
