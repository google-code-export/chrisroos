              <p>I was recently asked for my Amazon wishlist.  I wasn&#8217;t able to use email and was expected to write down the <span class="caps">URL</span>.  I had a look and found that the <span class="caps">URL</span> (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/IO9HVNCPEWGD">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/IO9HVNCPEWGD</a>) wasn&#8217;t paper or speech friendly.  Instead of attempting to convey this <span class="caps">URL</span>, I used the opportunity to create my own human friendly permalink for my wishlist (<a href="http://chrisroos.co.uk/amazonwishlist">chrisroos.co.uk/amazonwishlist</a>).  I actually started with a hyphenated variant (amazon-wishlist) but realised that the non-hyphenated version would be easier for someone to understand in conversation.</p>


	<p>This seems to tie in with what <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> has been talking about <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/11/20/solvingTheTinyurlCentraliz.html">recently</a>.</p>


	<p>I think this&#8217;d be quite a neat, and fairly easy, little webapp to build.  It would need a simple interface for managing permalinks and the ability to work with multiple domains.  Hmm, I&#8217;m tempted to give this a shot unless anyone knows of anything similar already out there?</p>
