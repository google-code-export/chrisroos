              <p>I recently received a letter reply to an enquiry I made to <a href="http://southeasternrailway.co.uk/">South Eastern Trains</a>.  I wanted to make the text available (I don&#8217;t like reading text in images) but didn&#8217;t want to type it all out.  Having scanned it in, I looked around for some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"><span class="caps">OCR</span></a> software, for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/">Mac</a>, that would extract the text for me.  Through the (relatively large amount of) search result noise, I managed to find a reference to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">tesseract</a>.  Installing from <a href="http://www.macports.org/">Mac Ports</a> was easy but actually getting useful output was slightly tricker.  I was trying to extract the text from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2688362397/">this letter</a> but kept getting garbled output.  I tried a few things before stumbling across <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OCR">this page</a> that suggests making the image greyscale and ensuring that the extension is .tif (not .tiff).  I duly complied, using <a href="http://seashore.sourceforge.net/">Seashore</a> to convert the image to greyscale, and tried again.  This time the text was extracted perfectly (even the addresses, that appear in two columns, were extracted correctly).</p>
