              <p>I bought the <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en/allfeatures/3skypephone/">Skypephone</a> from <a href="http://three.co.uk">three</a> about a week ago.  I haven&#8217;t managed to get my number transfered yet and as such I haven&#8217;t really used it in anger, but thought I&#8217;d write some random notes anyway.</p>


	<p>I didn&#8217;t get off too a good start with <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> <a href="http://3skypephone.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=154">not working</a> on the phone for two or three days after purchase.  Although Skype now works fine, it doesn&#8217;t seem to remember my password, which makes it a bit of a pain each time you want to log in.  I&#8217;ve used skype for text chatting but haven&#8217;t actually used it for voice yet so can&#8217;t comment on the quality.</p>


	<p>The phone is an <a href="http://www.amoi.com"><span class="caps">AMOI</span></a> (I&#8217;m not 100% sure that&#8217;s the correct site as this phone doesn&#8217;t appear there) WP-S1.  It feels remarkably similar to <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> phones I&#8217;ve used in the past.  In fact, the only difference I&#8217;ve found so far is the keys you press to lock the keypad (star then top-left button, rather than top-left button then start).</p>


	<p>If you try to visit a website beginning with www then a popup appears telling you that you&#8217;ll be charged for data used.  If you visit a website that doesn&#8217;t start www (e.g. <a href="http://m.twitter.com">m.twitter.com</a>) then you don&#8217;t get this message.  This made me wonder whether I was still being charged for the data I was using &#8211; I guess I must be, right?</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve connected the phone to my computer successfully using bluetooth and used it to transfer some <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/sets/72157603224666780/">photos</a> I took yesterday with the 2 megapixel camera.</p>


	<p>I think I should be able to use the phone as a modem but the supplied CD contains Windows only software.</p>


	<p>Hmm, that&#8217;s about all for now I think.</p>
