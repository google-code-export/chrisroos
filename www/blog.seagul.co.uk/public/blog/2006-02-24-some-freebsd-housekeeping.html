              <p>I use <a href="http://www.exonetric.com/">exonetric</a> to host this <a href="http://www.typosphere.org">typo</a> instance.  It&#8217;s on a <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">freebsd</a> virtual server so I have to maintain everything.  For a long time, I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.mysql.org">mysql</a> 4.  This is fine apart from a problem during initial installation causing it not to start automatically on machine restart.  This meant that whenever the virtual machine was rebooted I had to manually restart mysql, which basically wouldn&#8217;t happen until I actually noticed it &#8211; not cool.</p>


	<p>I spent the time today to upgrade to mysql 5.  Luckily this solved the auto start problem and mysql now comes up with the machine.</p>


	<p>Although incredibly interesting (hmm) that wasn&#8217;t really the point of the post.  This is&#8230;  Since using freebsd I&#8217;ve always relied on <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/">ports</a> (instructions for compilation of software) for the installation of software.  When installing mysql today, I used the pre-compiled package binary instead.  I&#8217;m amazed at how much faster it is; and now really can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve been bothering with the ports all this time.  I guess it was some kind of anal retentive control I thought I was getting by compiling the software myself; when infact I was only ever compiling with the default options and just wasting time&#8230;  Ho hum.</p>


	<p>Two moral&#8217;s here me thinks.  Use packages if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing (I don&#8217;t).  Don&#8217;t mess around with things you don&#8217;t understand (manually deleting ports dir before un-installing ports and then expecting packages to just overwrite them.  Oh well, it seems ok).</p>
