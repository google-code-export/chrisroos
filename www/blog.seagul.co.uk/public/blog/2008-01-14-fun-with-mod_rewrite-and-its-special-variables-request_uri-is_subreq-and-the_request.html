              <p>I wasted a few hours of my life, over the weekend, playing with <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a>.  I had, what I thought to be, a fairly simple problem to solve: I wanted requests for index.html within any subdirectory of my site to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection">redirected</a> to the root of that subdirectory.  So, a request for example.com/subdir/index.html would be (301) redirected to example.com/subdir/.</p>


	<p>I thought I could do this without using <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteCond">RewriteCond</a>.  I tried something like this.</p>


<div class="code"><pre><code>
RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.html$ $1 [R=301]
</code></pre></div>

	<p>I would expect this to match requests for URLs that end with index.html and redirect them to the <span class="caps">URL</span> minus index.html.  Although this correctly redirected /subdir/index.html to /subdir/ it would also attempt to redirect /subdir/ to /subdir/ resulting in an infinite loop.  It took me a very long time to work out, what I believe, is going on.  If I understand correctly, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">apache</a> will send every request (i.e. not just the request you issue from the browser) through mod_rewrite.  When we request /subdir/, apache will try, and fail, to match that <span class="caps">URL</span> with our regex (/subdir/ doesn&#8217;t end with index.html).  Internally, apache then &#8216;requests&#8217; index.html (since index.html is the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex">DirectoryIndex</a>).  This request matches our regex which results in apache sending the 301 redirect and us ending up with an infinite loop.  If I mis-understand what&#8217;s going on please feel free to correct me.</p>


	<p>Based on this assumption, I figured I&#8217;d need to use RewriteCond to somehow ignore the internal request for index.html.  I initially added a condition that checked for the <span class="caps">REQUEST</span>_URI ending in index.html (<code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} index\.html$</code>).  This suffered the same problem as my initial attempt.  A little more reading led me to the IS_SUBREQ special variable.  I thought this might allow me to ignore the &#8216;internal request&#8217; for index.html (<code>RewriteCond %{IS_SUBREQ} false</code>) but I couldn&#8217;t get it to have any effect.</p>


	<p>In searching for answers to this problem I kept seeing <span class="caps">THE</span>_REQUEST special variable used in the solution, although never an explanation as to why it&#8217;s used (specifically in preference to <span class="caps">REQUEST</span>_URI).  I ended up using <span class="caps">THE</span>_REQUEST in my solution (not technically my solution as I stole it from a site that I failed to bookmark) and it seems to work OK.</p>


<div class="code"><pre><code>
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,9}\ /.*index\.html\ HTTP/
RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.html$ $1 [R=301,L]
</code></pre></div>

	<p>I&#8217;m guessing that this is because <span class="caps">THE</span>_REQUEST contains the full details (the stuff that appears in the log file) of the request from the client (browser) and will therefore be empty for any &#8216;internal requests&#8217;.  Anyone know if my assumptions are correct?</p>
