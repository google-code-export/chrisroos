              <p>A bit of an unordered list of features I&#8217;d like to see in a feed reader.  It&#8217;s very possible these exist in some readers that I&#8217;m not aware of (I&#8217;ve moved from <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">desktop app on windows</a> through <a href="http://bloglines.com/">bloglines</a> and <a href="http://www.rojo.com">rojo</a> to <a href="http://www.feedshow.com">feedshow</a>).</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Comment from within the reader.  This would then automatically subscribe to a feed of the comments so that I could poll the updates.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Notify me when feeds haven&#8217;t been accessible for a while.  Maybe the address has changed or the reader cannot interpret the feed correctly; either way, I&#8217;d like to know so that I can make an informed decision about what to do.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>When a page offers multiple feed formats, I don&#8217;t want to be asked what format to subscribe to.  The program should know the format it supports best and choose that.  As I type this, I&#8217;m thinking that this is more difficult if there is a choice between full and summary content.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>If an existing article is &#8216;refreshed&#8217; then diff it.  If it hasn&#8217;t changed then I don&#8217;t want to see it.  If it has changed, then highlight the changes for me.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Show html in articles sensibly (rojo seemed to fail miserably on this front).</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Host a &#8216;live&#8217; (i.e. dynamically generated copy of my feeds in opml) &#8211; I can&#8217;t think of any reason to have to import/export these.</li>
	</ul>
