              </p>
          
              <p>I&#8217;ve installed a handful of wireless networks over the years and have always gone for <a href="http://www.netgear.co.uk">Netgear</a> products due to price and my perceived quality of the items.</p>


	<p>I recently had another wireless network to install which was to span a house and an office at the end of the garden.  Having looked at the latest Netgear offerings I decided upon the <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/rangemax_wirelessrouter_wpn824.php"><span class="caps">WPN824</span></a>.  This was mainly due to the boasts of &#8220;Network range extended by up to 400 feet&#8221;.  Although the item was slightly more expensive (£73.91 ex Vat at time of writing<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>) than the alternatives, I was figuring on not having to buy additional antennae for the individual computers and therefore saving that way.  The first problem I had was that I had mis-interpreted the device as an <span class="caps">ADSL</span> router rather than a Broadband router.  Because of this oversight I had to purchase an additional <span class="caps">ADSL</span> Ethernet Modem (<a href="http://netgear.co.uk/wired_adsl_router_dg632.php">Netgear <span class="caps">DG632</span></a>) for £36.45 ex Vat at the time of writing.  This was already going over budget.</p>


	<p>On installation I was greeted with very dissapointing results.  I was using <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/rangemax_wirelesspci_wpn311.php">Netgear <span class="caps">WPN311</span></a> cards in each desktop and the wireless router was placed equidistant from each machine (albeit one had to travel through a couple of walls and the other through open air and wooden divides).</p>


	<p>I tried all of the channels, with and without encryption and selecting the network types (b, g, b &#38; g, 108MB only), all to no avail.  I was getting a signal but not one that was strong and consistent enough to work with.</p>


	<p>The money I thought I was saving by buying the more expensive router was about to disapear with the addition of a <a href="http://solwise.co.uk/wireless-indoorantenna-omni-105os.htm">5db omni-direction antennae</a> for each of the desktop machines.</p>


	<p>With the antennae added, wireless performance was ok, although only really when running at a max of 54Mbs (i.e. I was still not able to take advantage of the 108Mbs speeds).</p>


	<p>I still wasn&#8217;t amazingly happy with this performance and so obtained a <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/wireless_adslrouter_dg834g.php">Netgear <span class="caps">DG834G</span></a> ADSL/Wireless router combo.  This was installed in place of the <span class="caps">WPN824</span>/DG632 pair and to my slight surprise both faster network speeds and better consistency prevailed.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m currently in the process of sending the <span class="caps">WPN824</span>/DG632 units back to eBuyer on the basis that they (well, the <span class="caps">WPN824</span> at least) do not live up to their promises.</p>


	<p>As indicated at the top of the article, I&#8217;m generally pleased with Netgear products but have been let down by the exagerated promises of this particular device.</p>
