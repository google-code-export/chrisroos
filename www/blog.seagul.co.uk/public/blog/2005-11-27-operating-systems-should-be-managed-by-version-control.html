              <p>I spent from about 09:30 until 15:00 yesterday trying to get some graphics software talking to two output devices (basically printers) on Windows.</p>


	<p>On arrival, it kinda worked, although not as requested.  There were some additional problems that needed to be sorted too.</p>


	<p>I managed to go from a working state to a non-working state very quickly (great) and then had to spend several hours trying to return it.  In the end, I had one of the connected machines talking correctly but couldn&#8217;t for the life of me work out the other one.</p>


	<p>I found myself trying to diagnose the problem (complaints of missing driver files / mis-communication between ports) using several (very good) utilities from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com">sys internals</a>.  Indeed these did help to a certain extent but it was not easy.</p>


	<p>Coming from a development perspective where every little change is registered in version control, it got me to thinking.  If the changes to an operating system were version controlled I&#8217;d be able to see exactly what changed during every &#8216;upgrade&#8217; to the OS, making it potentially easier to spot the cause of a problem and far easier to roll back to a working state.</p>


	<p>I know that Windows XP (which this machine was running) offers a kind of &#8216;rollback&#8217; functionality; but, to be honest, I don&#8217;t trust it in the slightest; hence not using it.</p>


	<p>Mmm, I think I might install a fresh copy of XP, add all files to version control (which I guess might not even work), change something and then diff between the versions.  I can already think of problems when diffing registry files as they are in binary format so it will not be easy to see differences.. Although, I guess it wouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to store registry files in a text format, i.e. customize the version control somehow.  Just an idea.</p>
