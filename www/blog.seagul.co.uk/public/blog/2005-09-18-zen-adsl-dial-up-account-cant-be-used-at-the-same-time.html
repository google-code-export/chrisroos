              <p>This may be obvious to others&#8230;</p>


	<p>Last night I was trying to connect to my home PC remotely via <span class="caps">SSH</span>.  This usually works fine but wasn&#8217;t last night.  I assumed that it was the <span class="caps">ADSL</span> connection at home playing up and gave up for the evening.  On arrival home this morning I found that everything was working as expected (from within the Lan).  I then dialled out and experienced the same problems (not being able to connect remotely).  I tried another dial-up connection (which wasn&#8217;t working last night) and this time the remote access worked fine.  After a few more tests, it appears that by connecting to my <span class="caps">ISP</span> (<a href="http://www.zenadsl.co.uk">Zen</a>) via dial-up using the same account as my <span class="caps">ADSL</span>, my <span class="caps">ADSL</span> Internet connectivity is disrupted.  It doesn&#8217;t actually drop the connection (according to the status on the router), rather just does not transmit/receive any traffic.  Lesson learned &#8211; don&#8217;t use my Zen dial-up account when I am expecting my <span class="caps">ADSL</span> to be active.</p>
