              <p>I wanted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"><span class="caps">OCR</span></a> another letter this morning and, as <a href="/articles/2008-07-21-open-source-optical-character-recognition-ocr-on-the-mac">before</a>, I used <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">tesseract</a> for the job.</p>


	<p>I ended up spending some time testing the quality of the output (the generated text) against different quality inputs (as defined by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">dpi</a> setting in my scanner software).  The results were not surprising. The best output, with only a couple of errors in the whole letter, came from the 300dpi scan (the highest I tried). The scan at 150dpi contained a handful of mistakes and at 96dpi the output was, in places, complete gibberish.</p>


	<p>In case this is of use to anyone I have copies of the, smaller, second page of the letter I was scanning, along with the OCRd output.  The scanner is an <a href="http://www.epson.co.uk/products/all_in_one_products/Stylus_DX4800.htm">Epson Stylus <span class="caps">DX4800</span></a> and I used <a href="http://seashore.sourceforge.net/">seashore</a> to convert the images, from colour jpegs, to greyscale tiffs.</p>

Nothing is ruled out in terms of further development, and I have met with a representative of mySociety to discuss ways of continuing to improve what we do.
I am fully supportive of the aims of the Free Our Bills campaign, and I am keen to work with the relevant House authorities to see what can be done to open up the legislative process to a broader audience.
I hope that this is helpful to your constituent.
