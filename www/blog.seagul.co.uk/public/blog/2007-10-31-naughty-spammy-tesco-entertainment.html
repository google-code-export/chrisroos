              <p>Are Tesco Entertainment the new <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/03/16/orange-orange-orange">Orange</a>?  They might just be you know.  See, I&#8217;ve been sad and pathetic enough to <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions">record</a> details of unwanted emails that I receive.  So far <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment">Tesco Entertainment</a>, bless &#8216;em, have been unable to remove me from their mailing list for 90 days.  I thought I&#8217;d write them a little email to, you know, ask them to stop spamming me.</p>


<blockquote>
Here&#8217;s a list of emails you&#8217;ve sent me.

	<ul>
	<li>Received: 26-Jun-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 11-Jul-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 27-Jul-2007</li>
		<li><strong>Unsubscribed</strong>: 30-Jul-2007 (although it appeared that I wasn’t actually signed up to any offers…)</li>
		<li>Received: 08-Aug-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 21-Aug-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 16-Oct-2007</li>
		<li>I emailed you on 17th Oct:
“I unsubscribed from you guys on the 30th July 2007 (interestingly, my preferences suggested that I wasn’t actually subscribed to any mailings in the first place). Since then, you’ve sent me Tesco Entertainment emails on the 8th Aug, 21st Aug and 16th Oct1. Please stop.  Cheers,  Chris  [1] http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment”</li>
		<li>Received: 30-Oct-2007</li>
	</ul>


	<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I&#8217;ve received four emails since unsubscribing on the 30th July.  I think three months is long enough to remove someone from your spam list isn&#8217;t it?  Oh, and you&#8217;ll also see I&#8217;ve emailed you in the past too.  It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to reply would it?</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>


Chris
