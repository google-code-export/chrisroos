              <p>I&#8217;ve often felt the need to search through our <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> repository to find, for example, when a method was removed/renamed.  As far as I&#8217;m aware there&#8217;s no easy way to do this using the standard subversion, or <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a>, tools.  A few days ago the need arose once more: I wanted to know when a particular class had stopped being used within our codebase.  It struck me that if I had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> file for each changeset that I&#8217;d be able to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> for the change I was looking for.  I hacked together a script to produce a diff of each changeset (actually, as I knew when the class was added, I only produced a diff for a subset of the changesets) and was able to find the information I needed.  The script is pasted below and on <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/svn_changesets/">google code</a>.  It assumes that you are running it from within an svn working direction.  It took a while to produce the diff files (I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have any stats) but the result was a really fast way of finding, otherwise hard to find, information.  I guess it&#8217;d be quite easy to automate the diff creation process so that you had an always up-to-date bunch of diff fies&#8230;</p>


	<p>Is this useful, or have I missed something obvious in Subversion or Trac that does exactly this?</p>
