              <p>Just yesterday I wanted to create a very quick rails app that didn&#8217;t rely on a database.</p>


	<p>I removed :active_record from the frameworks loaded in evironment, but apparently this wasn&#8217;t quite enough.  The setup and teardown methods in Test::Unit::TestCase were still attempting to load fixtures (which implies that active record is still present somewhere), which require the presence of a database.  This was causing tests not to run.  Having had a quick look at how active record intercepts the setup and teardown methods, it was relatively simple to stop it from doing so.</p>


	<p>Just add the code below within the Test::Unit::TestCase declaration in test_helper.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="ruby">
def self.dont_use_fixtures
  class_eval do
    def self.method_added(method); end
    def setup; end
    def teardown; end
  end
end
</code></pre></div>

	<p>This still requires that you add dont_use_fixtures into each test class definition.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="ruby">
class MyTest &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
  dont_use_fixtures
  def test_
    # my first test
  end
end
</code></pre></div>

	<p>Having just written this it&#8217;s obvious now that it would make more sense to not require the declaration in each test class (as we supposedly don&#8217;t even have access to active record).  We should probably also play fair and pass messages back to our parent if method_added isn&#8217;t being called with either setup or teardown.</p>


	<p>The new code becomes (again, in Test::Unit::TestCase definition in test_helper).</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="ruby">
def self.method_added(method)
  super unless [:setup, :teardown].include?(method.to_sym)
end
def setup; end
def teardown; end
</code></pre></div>

	<p>This appears to work ok&#8230;</p>
