              <p>I had the mis-fortune to sign-up with uk2.net (intentionally not linked &#8211; how petty) quite some time ago, registering domains at first and subsequently using their free email service.</p>


	<p>Although there are lots of things wrong with them; the one that has annoyed me for a while, and has done so again this morning; is their lack of &#8216;remind me of my password&#8217;.</p>


	<p>It would appear that one of my old email addresses is still active on their server &#8211; and is still happily forwarding all mail to my primary email account.</p>


	<p>Luckily, the only mail to come through this account is spam.  Great.</p>


	<p>As this account is so very very old I have absolutely no recollection of the password used.  I&#8217;ve tried to re-set it or remove the account in the past; to no avail.</p>


	<p>I just tried again this morning &#8211; still no luck.  Apparently I can <a href="http://mailme.uk2net.com/max_password.html">buy the privilege</a> of a password reset/reminder by sending the princely sum of Â£10.  Just like all the other email services on the web&#8230;  Yeah.  Right.</p>
