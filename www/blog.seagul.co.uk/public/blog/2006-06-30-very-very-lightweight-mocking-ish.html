              <p><a href="http://www.floehopper.org/">James</a> has been developing a great <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">mocking</a> framework at <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">work</a> which makes life real easy when it comes to testing interaction between objects.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve spent a couple of hours this week re-implementing <a href="http://chimprawk.blogspot.com">Fred Stutzmans</a> <a href="http://chimprawk.blogspot.com/2006/06/simple-microid-verifier.html">Micro Id Verifier</a> in ruby (I&#8217;ll post it soon, just some database persistence to add).  The job of the validator is to connect to a given url and compare any <a href="http://microid.org/">micro_id</a> found on that page with an expected micro_id supplied by the user.  All of my development has been off-line yet I needed a way to test that my objects were doing their job (i.e. connecting to the Internet).  It&#8217;s actually irrelevant that I was off-line at the time, I&#8217;d still need a repeatable way of ensuring my objects are doing their jobs.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m using <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/index.html">Net::HTTP</a> to look after grabbing the html for a given page and am certainly not worried about testing the workings of that library.  What I wanted to know, however, was that my client was utilising Net::HTTP in the way expected.  I didn&#8217;t have access to the mocking framework used at work so I fell back to a very lightweight method that we&#8217;ve used previously.</p>


	<p>The idea is to override the methods of an object that you expect to be called.  When the overridden method is called, we add the message to a log for later inspection.</p>


	<p>The implementation I have at the moment comprises four methods, although we could quite easily do away with &#8216;stub_instance_method&#8217; (it just adds some safety checking to &#8216;define_instance_method&#8217;).</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="ruby">
class Object

  def metaclass
    class &lt;&lt; self; self; end
  end

  def define_instance_method(sym, &#38;block)
    metaclass.__send__(:define_method, sym, &#38;block)
  end

  def stub_instance_method(sym, &#38;block)
    raise "#{self} does not respond to &lt;#{sym}&gt; and therefore cannot be stubbed" unless self.respond_to?(sym)
    define_instance_method(sym, &#38;block)
  end

  def __log__
    @__log__ ||= []
  end

end
</code></pre></div>

	<p>A (partially adapted and potentially non-working) example of this code being used in my tests is as follows.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="ruby">
def test_should_use_net_http_to_get_html_content
  url = 'http://localhost/page.htm'
  net_http = Object.new
  net_http.define_instance_method(:get) { |path| __log__ &lt;&lt; "get(#{path})" }
  http_client = HttpClient.new
  http_client.get_html(url, net_http)

  assert_equal ['get(/page.htm)'], net_http.__log__
end
</code></pre></div>

	<p>I define a &#8216;mock&#8217; Net::HTTP object (net_http) that records a message when it gets sent the &#8216;get&#8217; message.  I can then check the log to ensure that the expected method was called; and be (hopefully) safe in the knowledge that when I supply an actual Net::HTTP object the code does what I expect.</p>
