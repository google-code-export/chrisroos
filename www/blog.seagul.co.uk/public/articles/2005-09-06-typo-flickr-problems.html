              <p>I initially had this running on typo 2.5.5 but the flickr integration into the sidebar didn&#8217;t seem to work &#8211; unless I was doing something stupid which is entirely possible.  I applied patches from changesets 596 and 632 to no avail, so decided to export the trunk from svn and try that.  I still have the same problems which is slightly frustrating.  The db migrations built into the admin interface as amazing though.</p>


	<p><i>It would appear that it was my ignorance that was causing the flickr syndication problems.  I wasn&#8217;t entering the feed url correctly.  I&#8217;m wondering though, whether there should be some docs on the format of the feed url &#8211; I had to look at the flickr.rb source to find the format, and then search unrelated websites to find my actual flickr nsid</i>.</p>


	<p><i>Having got the flickr syndication working I&#8217;ve not reverted back to typo stable 2.5.5.</i></p>
