              <p>So, I was coming up against this problem in TextMate just recently.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a bit of a strange error in that you get seemingly conflicting output from TextMate.</p>


	<p>In a new TextMate document, I could run (by using the well handy, and very new to me, Ctrl-r key combo)..</p>


<pre>
/usr/bin/env ruby --version
=&gt; ruby 1.8.4 (2005-12-24) [i686-darwin8.7.1]

/usr/bin/which ruby
=&gt; /usr/local/bin/ruby

#!/usr/local/bin/ruby

puts "hello world" 
=&gt; hello world
</pre>

	<p>However, if I ran..</p>


<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts "hello world again" 
=&gt; env: ruby: No such file or directory
</pre>

	<p>Hmm, so <code>/usr/bin/env ruby --version</code> works, but when using the very same as the shebang interpreter we get an error.  Odd huh.</p>


	<p>Well, apparently not; if we read the textmate docs about <a href="http://macromates.com/textmate/manual/shell_commands#search_path">shell commands</a>.</p>


	<p>Although I, in no way, understand this completely; I blindly followed the instructions on that page and got TextMate back to health.</p>


	<p>In summary for those that don&#8217;t wish to read the docs..</p>


<pre>
# mkdir ~/.MacOSX/
# cat &gt;&gt; ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist
{ PATH = "/usr/local/bin"; }
</pre>

	<p><strong>Note</strong> You&#8217;ll want to change the path to the location of the binaries you want found.</p>


	<p>Then a quick log out and back in, and all is well with TextMate.  Yay.</p>

                    <p>The plist file can be either plain text or <span class="caps">XML</span> (maybe binary too); these instructions only work if the file is plain text or if it doesn&#8217;t exist yet. In my case, I already had an <span class="caps">XML</span> format file in that location.</p>


	<p>If it does exist, you can either edit it by hand or open it in the property list editor instead (type &#8216;open ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist&#8217; in the console) and add a String key called &#8216;PATH&#8217; under Root.</p>

                      I&#8217;ve recently upgraded the version of ruby on my machine and came up against problems similar to this. The problem previously was that textmate wasn&#8217;t finding ruby at all. This time, textmate was finding the wrong version of ruby. I fo...
