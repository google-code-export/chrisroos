              <p>I&#8217;ve always preferred <a href="http://www.tightvnc.com">TightVNC</a> for remote control of other machines.  When run through an <span class="caps">SSH</span> tunnel it provides secure, free, remote access.  The only problem is that it&#8217;s not amazingly easy to talk someone through installing it remotely, what with the need to configure suitable <span class="caps">SSH</span> software, firewall and TightVNC.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.fogcreek.com">Fogcreek</a> <a href="http://www.copilot.com">Copilot</a> offers a commercial solution to this by having both parties communicate via a mediator.  This is fine but I&#8217;m not keen on the cost.</p>


	<p>In a search for a free (potentially open source) alternative I stumbled across <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com">Team Viewer</a>.  I&#8217;ve just tested this over the Internet, connecting two computers, both of which are behind firewalls, and it works fine.</p>


	<p>I then started thinking that if there was a very simple <span class="caps">P2P VPN</span>, we could just use standard TightVNC and get round the cost and difficulty problems.  It turns out that there is a free <span class="caps">P2P VPN</span> in the form of <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc">Hamachi</a>.  Although I&#8217;ve not managed to test this over the Internet I have tested it connecting two different computers on a <span class="caps">LAN</span> (one of which is in VM Ware).  I also managed to successfully get TightVNC working, after opening the relevant port (5900) in the target machine.  For some reason Remote Desktop wouldn&#8217;t work &#8211; it seemed to connect but just left me with a black screen &#8211; but I was happy enough with Tight <span class="caps">VNC</span> anyway.</p>
