              <p>I had need to view a powerpoint presentation on my Mac.  In the past, I&#8217;ve uploaded them to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net">slideshare</a>, but that wasn&#8217;t suitable in this instance.  A quick google reveals some free java software by tonic systems.  Unfortunately (well, fortunately for tonic systems), they&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.tonicsystems.com/">bought</a> by google and the link to their software has disappeared.  Luckily, the google cache has a copy of the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cache:4BswR-sgicYJ:www.tonicsystems.com/products/viewer/+tonicsystems+java+viewer&#38;hl=en&#38;ct=clnk&#38;cd=1&#38;gl=uk">original page</a> with a <a href="http://downloads.tonicsystems.com/viewer/TonicPointViewer-1.4-OSX.zip">working link</a> to the download.</p>


	<p>This probably won&#8217;t remain relevant very long, what with the recent <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/17/googles-office-suite-complete-google-powerpoint-confirmed/">news</a> of google adding a powerpoint clone to their office suite.</p>

                    <p>Your post came up in my <span class="caps">RSS</span> search feed for &#8220;SlideShare&#8221;. Just curious &#8211; why was SlideShare not suitable in this instance. Did you have some features we don&#8217;t support. Did you know that we recently added ability to upload pdf&#8217;s? That seems to take care of some corner situations.</p>

                    <p>Rashmi,</p>


	<p>I needed to view a private slideshow.  Having just looked at slideshare again, I can see that this is definitely not available at the present time.</p>
