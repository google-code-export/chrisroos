              <p>A couple of days ago I was playing around with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~clkao/SVN-Mirror-0.68/lib/SVN/Mirror.pm"><span class="caps">SVN</span>::Mirror</a>, trying to remove some <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Plugins">dependencies</a> on third party repositories not in our control.</p>


	<p>All was going well until I tried to mirror a <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/mocha/">project</a> hosted on rubyforge.  On initialising the mirror, I kept receiving the error &#8220;source url not under source root&#8221; from line 72 in Ra.pm.</p>


	<p>After some very careful debugging (yeah, like I know anything about perl &#8211; <code>print "1";</code> was about the extent of it) of that perl file; I noticed that the $source_root variable didn&#8217;t contain the double slash<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  This causes a problem for the line <code>if substr($path, 0, length($source_root), '') ne $source_root;</code> as at this point, $path does contain the double slash.</p>


	<p>The value of $source_root is returned from a call to RA-&gt;get_repos_root (Subversion Repository Access code).  So; it would seem that the url was being normalised somewhere in the bowels of <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>.</p>


	<p>This was kinda confirmed by testing the svn client (which uses the code in the RA module just like <span class="caps">SVN</span>::Mirror) with urls containing additional slashes.  The url was always resolved and svn info would always show the normalised variant.  It was additionally(ish) tested by using the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> <a href="http://svn.collab.net/viewvc/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/ruby/">bindings</a> (which, as an aside, contain just about the most difficult to read Ruby code I&#8217;ve ever come across!)</p>


	<p>I would love to have followed the actual subversion c code to find the normalisation routine but I&#8217;m sadly not clever enough; so my findings had to suffice.</p>


	<p>Anyhoo, the outcome of the story is that I emailed Tom Copeland of rubyforge fame to ask about the deal with the double slashes.  Turns out that it was probably just a <a href="http://gforge.org/">gforge</a> default thing and Tom went ahead and promptly changed it.  I suddenly got very nervous that lots of arms would be thrown up with cries of &#8220;Who broke rubyforge?&#8221;, but so far it would appears to be ok.  Phew.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Not sure if anyone else had really noticed but the svn repositories on rubyforge used to contain a double slash between the domain and var path (i.e. rubyforge.org//var).</p>
