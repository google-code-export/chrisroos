              <p>I&#8217;m very much <strong>not</strong> a graphical person but when forced to dabble in any kind of image manipulation have always tried to use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The <span class="caps">GIMP</span></a>, over any commercial offerings.</p>


	<p>Just this afternoon I&#8217;ve spent some time trying to make the background of a very simple image transparent.  The image is a filled shape on a white background.  I wanted the white background to be transparent.</p>


	<p>I <em>think</em> I&#8217;ve finally found the best way to achieve this but may be way off mark.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Open the original image (jpeg image in this case).</li>
		<li>Use the &#8216;magic wand&#8217; (Select contiguous regions) and select the coloured shape.</li>
		<li>Move the selected shape to the side of the image.</li>
		<li>In the Layers view you should now have a new &#8216;Floating Selection (Floated Layer)&#8217;.  Right click on this layer and select &#8216;New layer&#8217;.  This converts the transient layer into a real layer.</li>
		<li>Click on the background layer to &#8216;select&#8217; the background of the image.</li>
		<li>Select Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Add Alpha Channel.</li>
		<li>We can now set the background to transparent by using Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Colour to Alpha and selecting our background colour (white in my case) as the From colour.</li>
		<li>Click Ok to set the background to transparent.</li>
		<li>Click on the Floated Layer (this is what the layer will be called unless you renamed it) to display it to the side of the image.</li>
		<li>Click the cross-hair (Move layers &#38; selections) tool and move the shape onto the now transparent background.</li>
		<li>That&#8217;s it, apart from saving the image in a format that either saves the layers (.xcf at least, maybe more) or at least deals with transparency (.gif and .png).</li>
	</ol>


	<p><em><strong>Update 18:07</strong> It seems that anything over and above simple shapes as I had and this practice fails because it&#8217;s not easy to initially cut the &#8216;foreground&#8217; image out.  But then again, maybe that&#8217;s just because I don&#8217;t know how to effectively &#8216;cut&#8217; images&#8230;</em></p>

                    <p>I found that you don&#8217;t actually need to select anything &#8211; I had a png image of a logo, which was some blue text on a white background. I started from step 7 and by default it turns white to alpha which is exactly what I wanted.</p>

                    <p>I still can get it to be transparent.</p>
