              <p>I often come across resources on the web that I&#8217;m interested in but want to look at in more detail later.  I currently use a combination of: storing urls in text files, placing links in my <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">backpack</a>, storing bookmarks in my browser and, in the past, tagging links with <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/to_read">to_read</a> in <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>.  I inevitably end up forgetting where I&#8217;ve stored these &#8216;bookmarks&#8217; and therefore miss out on that resource<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  In an attempt to consolidate places I can hide information, I&#8217;ve created a todo bundle in del.icio.us that currently contains the to_watch and to_read tags.  Doing that today ensured that I remembered to watch a <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">great presentation</a> by <a href="http://blame.ca/dick/">Dick Hardt</a> on the subject of <a href="http://www.identity20.com">identity 2.0</a>.  Cool.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> You could probably argue that because I forget about the resource, I can&#8217;t have been <em>that</em> interested in the first place&#8230;</p>

              <p>I heard (well, read) about <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">wesabe</a> this morning and thought I&#8217;d sign-up to find out what it was all about.  During the sign-up process I was asked for <em>two</em> security questions and answers &#8211; to be used in the event of me forgetting my password.  Although I was unable<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> to sign-up and use the service, I still got an amazing &#8216;non-customer experience&#8217;.  I was curious as to why they wanted me to answer two security questions in order to sign-up, and emailed them to that affect.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>I was about to signup to wesabe but I&#8217;ve been rejected by not entering my security questions.  I&#8217;m genuinely interested in your decision to require two security questions as well as an email address.  I get the impression that the current trend is to ask for an email address and provide a &#8216;reset password&#8217; type link that mails out a new password &#8211; maybe you are more aware of this due to the type of data being stored?</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>That was sent at 08:14.  This reply was received at 08:19.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Yes, your guess is spot on.  During our preview/beta period, one of the most common requests we had was for password resets.  It was easy enough to verify the source of those requests when we knew all of our users, but as the preview group grew, we weren&#8217;t able to confirm that we were actually resetting a password for the right person.  When we talked it over, we decided to use the model set by PayPal, since that seemed like the closest analog to our service in web applications.  Using a combination of security questions and access to a set email address provides two levels of authentication, and that&#8217;s what we wanted.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>I really want signup to be easier and faster, and yet still have people be able to get back to their data &#8211; and only their data &#8211; whenever they want.  I&#8217;m not happy with the length of the signup form, but it seems better than other options I&#8217;ve found so far.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>If you have suggestions or comments on this, I&#8217;d be very interested.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Whoah.  That&#8217;s pretty cool.  Right!?  I&#8217;ve actually had a very similar experience with <a href="http://www.claimid.com">claimid</a>.  I asked them to <a href="http://blog.claimid.com/2006/05/tips-and-tricks-your-name-in-the-url/">change my username</a> and the response confirming their action was through within ten minutes.</p>


	<p>In a &#8220;we wanna be that cool too&#8221; stylee, I&#8217;m opening myself up to spam galore<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> by offering my email address for your delectation:</p>


	<p><a href="mailto:chrisroos@reevoo.com">chrisroos@reevoo.com</a></p>


	<p>Feel free to email me, why not.</p>


	<p>[1] There&#8217;s a little white lie there to be fair.  Of course I <em>could&#8217;ve</em> signed up.  They didn&#8217;t put a spell on me (although that&#8217;d be cool) or anything.  It&#8217;s just that I feel uncomfortable giving out the answers to real questions (mother&#8217;s maiden name) and there&#8217;s zero chance of me remembering the answer to made up questions (favourite colour/day/smell).</p>


	<p>[2] I was going to cleverly protect my email addresses from prying robot eyes&#8230;  but really can&#8217;t be bothered.</p>

              <p>This post isn&#8217;t about sleep deprevation.  Instead, the witty title is referring to everyone&#8217;s newest, favouritist buzzword: <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST"><span class="caps">REST</span></a> (or Representational State Transfer).</p>


	<p>Scene setting with some things that have happened recently (in roughly this order):</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.reevoo.com/blogs/bengriffiths/">Ben</a> mentions that we need to think about splitting our application up to better distribute the load on servers.  I don&#8217;t completely &#8216;get it&#8217;.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> gets <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST"><span class="caps">REST</span></a> support <a href="http://www.ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/08/01/whats-new-in-edge-rails-simply-restful-support-and-how-to-use-it">baked in</a> (Ok, so this is pretty old news now)</li>
		<li>We spent quite a lot of time at <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">work</a> writing code to access the <a href="http://adwords.google.com">google adwords</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/">soap api</a></li>
		<li>I finally got (thanks to <a href="http://blog.floehopper.org">James</a>) why <a href="http://habtm.com/articles/2006/07/01/if-your-models-arent-namespaced-why-should-your-controllers-be-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-crud">some</a> rails folk have stated that following a RESTful design frees them up from having namespaced admin controllers.</li>
		<li>I spent quite a bit of time over the last two weeks really looking into the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt">atom syndication format</a> and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-11.txt">atom publishing protocol</a></li>
		<li>I spent a few hours at the weekend playing with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s3">amazon s3</a> service</li>
		<li><a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/11/15/the-s-stands-for-simple/">This</a> popped up recently and got an incredible amount of attention.</li>
		<li>I read an <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&#38;pa=showpage&#38;pid=388">interview</a> with <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/">Werner Vogel</a> (CTO of Amazon) that talks about everything being a service.  One quote in particular caught my attention.</li>
	</ul>


	<blockquote>
		<p>If you hit the Amazon.com gateway page, the application calls more than 100 services to collect data and construct the page for you.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<ul>
	<li>I took the plunge and just about stayed awake through <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">The Document</a>.  I found chapter 6 (and in particular 6.3.4) the most relevant as it explains <span class="caps">REST</span> in the context of the <span class="caps">URI</span> and <span class="caps">HTTP</span>.  I tend to drift off on when things are explained without real examples.</li>
		<li>I watched <a href="http://nubyonrails.com">Geoffrey Grosenbach&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.peepcode.org">peepcode</a> screencast on <a href="http://peepcode.com/articles/2006/10/08/restful-rails">restful rails</a>.</li>
		<li>I worked out how to use <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> and subscribed to some of the tags (keywords) mentioned above.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Wow.  You&#8217;d think with all that reading, listening and viewing I&#8217;d be right up on the subject.  Sadly I don&#8217;t feel as though that&#8217;s quite the case.</p>


	<p>Now.  I do see an advantage of a RESTful approach (particular the style currently advocated in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">rails</a>), over <span class="caps">SOAP</span>, when dealing with something like the google adwords api<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  But, what about services like currency conversion and syntax highlighting?  I can&#8217;t get these to fit into a RESTful style in my head (I guess I can&#8217;t find the resource in each case).  Instead, I see them as analogous to unix command line applications: pipe simple data in (an amount with two curencies or ruby code) and get simple data out (an amount in the new currency or syntax-highlighted ruby code).  Actually, I see them as remote procedure calls.  Are these types of services incompatible with the <span class="caps">REST</span> architectural style or have I missed something?  I&#8217;m starting to wonder if I&#8217;m getting too hung up on <span class="caps">REST</span> = <span class="caps">CRUD</span> and therefore missing some of the more fundamental points.  Either way, I definitely feel that it&#8217;d be good to see some more concrete examples in the <span class="caps">REST</span> vs <span class="caps">SOAP</span>/RPC/SOA arguments.  As stated above, I&#8217;m not so great in the abstract.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I had a few problems when interacting with the adwords api.  I don&#8217;t, however, feel that I have enough information to know whether the pain was caused by <a href="http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r">soap4r</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">soap</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/">api</a> or just my lack of knowledge.</p>

              <p>I don&#8217;t like giving out my real contact details in surveys / on-line forms, particularly telephone numbers.  I&#8217;m not an amazing fan of the telephone and as such very rarely (unless-I&#8217;m-really-certain-I-know-who-is-calling-and-even-then-it&#8217;s-not-guaranteed) answer it.  For this reason, I feel fairly justified in not wanting to enter my number into surveys / on-line forms.  I&#8217;m also pretty confident that the number of people that actually <em>need</em> a number to contact me on, are very very very few and far between.  So, if they don&#8217;t need my number, I guess they are either following the crowd, &#8220;but all the other forms ask for it&#8221;, or, they want to do bad things with it.  Either way, I&#8217;d rather they didn&#8217;t have it.</p>


	<p>There is a point (and a link no-less) to this rant.  Honest.  Wait.  It&#8217;s coming&#8230;</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/ioi/numbers/num_drama">Ofcom&#8217;s list of reserved numbers for official form filling in use<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></a></p>


	<p>I remembered this from the oftel days of yore but had been unable to find it in more recent searches.  Luckily, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_telephone_numbering_plan">wikipedia</a> came to the rescue this evening<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> That&#8217;s quite clearly not their actual intended purpose.  Right.</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> In the past, when requested for landline number, I&#8217;ve entered my, relatively recently disconnected, landline number.  There&#8217;s every chance that this has been (or is scheduled to be) re-allocated &#8211; prompting me to find a new number.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve personally found it to occur when the sandbox gets reset (i.e. data from the sandbox is deleted by google).  The solution in this instance is to remove the clientEmail from the soap headers.  Make one request without it and then you can add it back in again.  I guess it&#8217;s to do with the way that the accounts get auto created on the first request.</p>
