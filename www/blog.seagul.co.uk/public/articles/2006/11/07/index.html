                <p>I don&#8217;t like giving out my real contact details in surveys / on-line forms, particularly telephone numbers.  I&#8217;m not an amazing fan of the telephone and as such very rarely (unless-I&#8217;m-really-certain-I-know-who-is-calling-and-even-then-it&#8217;s-not-guaranteed) answer it.  For this reason, I feel fairly justified in not wanting to enter my number into surveys / on-line forms.  I&#8217;m also pretty confident that the number of people that actually <em>need</em> a number to contact me on, are very very very few and far between.  So, if they don&#8217;t need my number, I guess they are either following the crowd, &#8220;but all the other forms ask for it&#8221;, or, they want to do bad things with it.  Either way, I&#8217;d rather they didn&#8217;t have it.</p>


	<p>There is a point (and a link no-less) to this rant.  Honest.  Wait.  It&#8217;s coming&#8230;</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/ioi/numbers/num_drama">Ofcom&#8217;s list of reserved numbers for official form filling in use<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></a></p>


	<p>I remembered this from the oftel days of yore but had been unable to find it in more recent searches.  Luckily, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_telephone_numbering_plan">wikipedia</a> came to the rescue this evening<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> That&#8217;s quite clearly not their actual intended purpose.  Right.</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> In the past, when requested for landline number, I&#8217;ve entered my, relatively recently disconnected, landline number.  There&#8217;s every chance that this has been (or is scheduled to be) re-allocated &#8211; prompting me to find a new number.</p>
