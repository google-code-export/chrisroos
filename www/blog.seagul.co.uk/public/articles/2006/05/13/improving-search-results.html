              <p>This will be obvious to most people, especially anyone that&#8217;s taken the slightest bit of interest in their search engine rankings.  If text in the url matches the search query then that page is likely to get ranked higher than a page where the only the body matches the search query.</p>


	<p>There is an <a href="http://blog.claimid.com/2006/05/tips-and-tricks-your-name-in-the-url/">explanation</a> from the <a href="http://www.claimid.com">claimid</a> folks or you can see it for yourself by <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&#38;q=chris+roos&#38;btnG=Google+Search">googling for me</a>.  My <a href="http://www.odeo.com">odeo</a> profile appears third in the results (as of right now).  The url contains my name but apart from that it is essentially a blank page containing no info about me.</p>


	<p>Anyhoo, the main point of this was to say that I emailed the claimid folks this morning to request they change my username from chrisjroos (my common moniker) to chrisroos.  I&#8217;m not even exaggerating when I say that they&#8217;d made the change and replied within ten minutes of my request.  That&#8217;s fantastic service.</p>

                    <p>I made your sqlite in-memory fix into a plugin and am using it with my tests.</p>


	<p>Can I publish this plugin, or would you rather have control of it?</p>


	<p>Thanks again! This is a great tip!</p>

                    <p>topfunky: I&#8217;m more than happy for you to release it.  Sounds much more useful than my hacky instructions.  Cool.</p>
