                <p>There currently doesn&#8217;t seem to be a <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">typo</a> sidebar for <a href="http://www.allsonsuming.net">allconsuming</a> &#8211; I kinda think there should be.</p>


	<p>Having said that, maybe it&#8217;s not required as allconsuming already provide javascript to insert the contents into your blog.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;ll see.</p>

                <p>I had the mis-fortune to sign-up with uk2.net (intentionally not linked &#8211; how petty) quite some time ago, registering domains at first and subsequently using their free email service.</p>


	<p>Although there are lots of things wrong with them; the one that has annoyed me for a while, and has done so again this morning; is their lack of &#8216;remind me of my password&#8217;.</p>


	<p>It would appear that one of my old email addresses is still active on their server &#8211; and is still happily forwarding all mail to my primary email account.</p>


	<p>Luckily, the only mail to come through this account is spam.  Great.</p>


	<p>As this account is so very very old I have absolutely no recollection of the password used.  I&#8217;ve tried to re-set it or remove the account in the past; to no avail.</p>


	<p>I just tried again this morning &#8211; still no luck.  Apparently I can <a href="http://mailme.uk2net.com/max_password.html">buy the privilege</a> of a password reset/reminder by sending the princely sum of Â£10.  Just like all the other email services on the web&#8230;  Yeah.  Right.</p>

                <p>Looks to me like <a href="http://www.douban.net">douban</a> is very similar to <a href="http://www.allconsuming.net">all consuming</a>.  I think the difference may be the ability to add more structured rating to the content in douban.  Not sure though.</p>

                <p>... and aggregate the data.  Compare average daily spend between people.</p>


	<p>Doesn&#8217;t ask for any personal data, including what it was spent on, just how much.  May or (most likely) may not be useful in a social kinda way.</p>


	<p>Probably not.</p>

                <p>Well it seems that the inland revenue have taken a leaf out of ticket master&#8217;s &#8220;school of less secure passwords&#8221; book.  Your password must be between 8 and 12 characters and be alphanumeric.</p>


	<p>Completely and utterly pathetic.</p>
