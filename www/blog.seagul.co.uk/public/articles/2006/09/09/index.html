                <p>I picked up on this yesterday and now cannot find the article (it was something to do with manipulating a rails app from the console).  Sorry.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">irb(main):001:0&gt; class Foo

irb(main):005:2&gt; end
irb(main):006:1&gt; end
=&gt; nil
irb(main):007:0&gt; Foo.new.bar
NoMethodError: private method `bar' called for #&lt;Foo:0x358304&gt;

	<p>Although cool, I can&#8217;t think of any situations where this would have been useful.  Ho hum.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/07/12/using-in-memory-active-record-objects-with-associations-for-testing">previously written</a> about using in memory active record objects for testing.</p>


	<p>In doing so recently, I&#8217;ve found it necessary to define the id of the in memory object.  By default this is obviously nil as it has not been persisted.  In addition, it is not possible to set it during normal object construction.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_ruby"><span class="ident">person</span> <span class="punct">=</span> <span class="constant">Person</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">new</span><span class="punct">(</span><span class="symbol">:id</span> <span class="punct">=&gt;</span> <span class="number">1</span><span class="punct">)</span>
<span class="ident">p</span> <span class="ident">person</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">id</span>
<span class="comment">#=&gt; nil</span></code></pre></div>

	<p>However, we can give the person constructor a block, setting the id just after creation.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_ruby"><span class="ident">person</span> <span class="punct">=</span> <span class="constant">Person</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">new</span> <span class="punct">{</span> <span class="punct">|</span><span class="ident">p</span><span class="punct">|</span> <span class="ident">p</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">id</span> <span class="punct">=</span> <span class="number">1</span> <span class="punct">}</span>
<span class="ident">p</span> <span class="ident">person</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">id</span>
<span class="comment">#=&gt; 1</span></code></pre></div>

	<p>Cool.</p>

                <p>I can&#8217;t recommend <a href="http://www.asmallorange.com">A Small Orange</a> enough.  They offer very competitive shared hosting and don&#8217;t charge for &#8220;upgrades&#8221; like the majority of hosts.  From their site..</p>


	<p>Many hosts put artificial limits on what you can do in order to force you to upgrade your account, just so you will buy that one extra MySQL database or extra email account you need. At A Small Orange, we don&#8217;t believe in artificial limitations so we offer the following unlimited features on all our hosting accounts:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Unlimited <span class="caps">POP3</span>/IMAP Mail Accounts</li>
		<li>Unlimited MySQL Databases</li>
		<li>Unlimited Mailing Lists</li>
		<li>Unlimited Email Forwarders</li>
		<li>Unlimited Subdomains</li>
		<li>Unlimited Parked and Addon Domains</li>
		<li>Unlimited <span class="caps">FTP</span> Accounts</li>
	</ul>


	<p>I have been offering web and email hosting for a couple of local firms (harking back to me self-[un]employed days).  I wanted to get them moved to someone else (to relieve me of the burden) but felt responsible for getting them a good deal.  They only have small static sites so I was reluctant to pay for expensive hosting that offered unnecessary features.  I found <a href="http://www.dataflame.co.uk">dataflame</a> to be relatively cheap.  Unfortunately the &#8216;cheapness&#8217; soon disappears once we look at &#8216;upgrading&#8217; our account with such &#8216;features&#8217; as parked domains.  In fairness, most hosts seem to charge for these automated extras, making me very happy to discover <span class="caps">ASO</span>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve moved the accounts over to <span class="caps">ASO</span> and have had no problems to date.</p>


	<p>I actually had reason to contact <span class="caps">ASO</span> yesterday (enable ssh access and one other matter).  Ssh access was configured within five minutes of my sending the email.  The other matter was resolved within one hour.  That&#8217;s some good supportin&#8217; they got goin&#8217; on.</p>


	<p>They also boast <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">rails</a> support but I haven&#8217;t got round to testing this yet.</p>


	<p>In fairness, I actually moved hosting for one of the firms to <a href="http://www.bluehost.com">bluehost</a> originally.  These guys also offer great rates and features (not quite as great as <span class="caps">ASO</span>).  We just had one problem &#8211; there are consistent network failures between us (at least parts of the UK) and them (somewhere in the States).  They can see the problem but as it lies with one of their upstream providers apparently there is not much they can do about it.  Hmmm.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s enough praising for now.  Go <span class="caps">ASO</span>.</p>
