              <p>I regularly access the Internet from three different locations.  Quite often, I will log into my bank account or other sites that have complicated login procedures (i.e. require more than just username and password) from each of these sites.  I&#8217;m not good at remembering this stuff so used to have it stored in some software called <a href="http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/ew/ewallet.html">eWallet</a> on the Pc.  This was fine when I was on one computer most of the time but as soon as I started using multiple computers, including a Mac, it became problematic.</p>


	<p>To get around the multiple computer problem, I ditched eWallet and now store all my info online, in a self-hosted slightly customised version of <a href="http://www.instiki.org">instiki</a>.  To achieve this in what I hope is some kind of secure way, I encrypt each set of data using <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">gpg</a>.  I then store this data in its own wiki page.  The wiki itself has very basic password protection and is not hosted over ssl but I&#8217;m thinking that because the decryption takes place on the client I should be ok.  Granted, it means that my secret key is on three computers and could therefore be compromised but I hope this is unlikely&#8230;</p>


	<p>The (hopefully) constant availability of my data outweighs the slight pain caused by having to decrypt the data each time.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m genuinely not sure if this is a great idea or not regards security so maybe someone cleverer than I could advise if you come across this&#8230;</p>
