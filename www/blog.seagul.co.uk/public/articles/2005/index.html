                <p>(Probably) the standard way to print to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF">Pdf</a> in Windows is to buy <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/main.html">Adobe Acrobat</a> or use one of the alternatives (which come with various different licences and are of varying quality; from experience over the last couple of years).</p>


	<p>There is, however, a completely free alternative, providing you don&#8217;t mind going through a couple of steps to implement it (which I don&#8217;t).</p>


	<p>The basic premise is that you print to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a> using a PostScript compatible printer driver and then use <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript</a> to convert from PostScript to Pdf.</p>


	<p>These instructions work in Windows XP but should be very similar in all versions of Windows.</p>


	<h3>Install PostScript compatible printer.</h3>


	<ol>
	<li>Add a Printer.</li>
		<li>Choose &#8216;Local printer&#8217; and do not &#8216;automatically detect&#8217;.</li>
		<li>Select &#8216;FILE: (Print to File)&#8217; in the list next to &#8216;Use the following port&#8217;.</li>
		<li>Choose a PS printer.  I&#8217;m currently using HP Color LaserJet PS.</li>
		<li>Select whether you want to use this as your default printer and choose no to printing a test page.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Download and install <span class="caps">AFPL</span> Ghostscript</h3>


	<ol>
	<li>Visit the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript site</a> and follow the &#8216;Obtaining <span class="caps">AFPL</span> Ghostscript <version>&#8217; link.</li>
		<li>Download the version for Windows, which at the time of writing is called  gs853w32.exe.</li>
		<li>Double click the downloaded file to install.  Use the defaults during installation.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Download and install GSview</h3>


	<ol>
	<li>Visit the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/index.htm">GSview site</a> and follow the &#8216;Obtaining GSview 4.7 link&#8217;.</li>
		<li>Download the version for Windows, which at the time of writing is called  gsv47w32.exe.</li>
		<li>Double click the downloaded file to install.  Use the defaults during installation.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Print something</h3>


	<ol>
	<li>Open a file and choose to print to your PostScript printer.</li>
		<li>On clicking the Print button, you will be prompted to specify a filename to save the PostScript document to.  Supply the full path to the file here, for example &#8216;c:\page.ps&#8217;.  Although the .ps extension is optional it makes it easier to open directly in GSview if this is supplied.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Convert the PostScript file to Pdf</h3>


	<ol>
	<li>Double click on the &#8216;c:\page.ps&#8217; file to open it in GSview.</li>
		<li>Click OK to close the software registration prompt and you will see the PostScript interpretation of your file on the screen.</li>
		<li>Click File &gt; Convert and choose &#8216;pdfwrite&#8217; as the device, a suitable resolution (default of 600 should be fine) and click OK.  You will be prompted to save the converted Pdf file somewhere</li>
		<li>Enter the filename to save the file with, noting that .pdf doesn&#8217;t get added automatically, e.g. specify page.pdf.</li>
		<li>Open the new .pdf file in either <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Adobe Reader</a> or <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/13/windows-adobe-acrobat-reader-alternative">an alternative</a></li>
	</ol>

                <p>I was taking a look at the <a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/the_best_web_20_software_of_2005.htm">best web 2.0 software</a> when I came across a to do list alternative to <a href="http://www.tadalist.com">tada</a> called <a href="http://voo2do.com/">voo2do</a>.</p>


	<p>I just signed up to take a look, but unfortunately wasn&#8217;t amazingly impressed.  Fortunately it is easy to <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/26/it-should-be-easy-to-cancel-online-accounts">cancel your account</a>.</p>


	<p>It is obviously subjective but the interface to voo2do isn&#8217;t amazing, although there is some great use of Ajax to let you tab between input fields when entering tasks.  I also found it too complicated for my simple mind.  I guess I think a to do list should literally be a list of one line items that need to be done at some/any point in time (which is exactly what tada offers, nothing more and nothing less).  I think that once you need something more than that, it probably doesn&#8217;t live on a todo list but in something slightly more structured.</p>


	<p>I certainly think there are improvements that could be made to tada (some of which can be overcome with the use of <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">greasemonkey</a> and this <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/754">tada user script</a>) but for now it&#8217;s going to be what I stick with.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve been using the reminders feature of <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">backpack</a> to text me when I need to be doing something time specific.  As per <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16">this</a> thread in the forum, although I get the text messages, there is no subject; meaning I have to remember what it was that I wanted to be reminded about.  Hmmm.</p>


	<p>Following the advice from that thread, I just set-up a forwarding rule on my <a href="http://www.fastmail.fm">email providers</a> server to forward reminder alerts from backpack to my orange account.  This is in place of getting backpack to send directly to my orange email.  I now get the subjects in my text messages as expected.  Yay.</p>

                <p>As <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/18/pwdhash">mentioned previously</a> I&#8217;ve started migrating my online accounts to use <a href="http://www.pwdhash.com">pwdhash</a>  Yesterday was the turn of <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk">ticketmaster</a>.  Well, it turns out their maximum password length is 12 characters.  My key (let alone hashed password) is greater than 12 characters so I&#8217;ve had to leave it as it was, negating the security and convenience of using pwdhash.  There is absolutely no reason ever (at least not that I can think of ;-)) to impose this limit on a password.</p>


	<p>Bad ticketmaster.</p>

                <p>I spent from about 09:30 until 15:00 yesterday trying to get some graphics software talking to two output devices (basically printers) on Windows.</p>


	<p>On arrival, it kinda worked, although not as requested.  There were some additional problems that needed to be sorted too.</p>


	<p>I managed to go from a working state to a non-working state very quickly (great) and then had to spend several hours trying to return it.  In the end, I had one of the connected machines talking correctly but couldn&#8217;t for the life of me work out the other one.</p>


	<p>I found myself trying to diagnose the problem (complaints of missing driver files / mis-communication between ports) using several (very good) utilities from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com">sys internals</a>.  Indeed these did help to a certain extent but it was not easy.</p>


	<p>Coming from a development perspective where every little change is registered in version control, it got me to thinking.  If the changes to an operating system were version controlled I&#8217;d be able to see exactly what changed during every &#8216;upgrade&#8217; to the OS, making it potentially easier to spot the cause of a problem and far easier to roll back to a working state.</p>


	<p>I know that Windows XP (which this machine was running) offers a kind of &#8216;rollback&#8217; functionality; but, to be honest, I don&#8217;t trust it in the slightest; hence not using it.</p>


	<p>Mmm, I think I might install a fresh copy of XP, add all files to version control (which I guess might not even work), change something and then diff between the versions.  I can already think of problems when diffing registry files as they are in binary format so it will not be easy to see differences.. Although, I guess it wouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to store registry files in a text format, i.e. customize the version control somehow.  Just an idea.</p>

                </p>

                <p>This started out as a few paragraphs at the end of the <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/26/it-should-be-easy-to-cancel-online-accounts">previous post</a> but I thought it better suited on it&#8217;s own.</p>


	<p>In my current thinking, I basically equate transparency with confidence.  Traditionally, people don&#8217;t tell you how much things cost (a sweeping statement I know).  They may have example prices that can be negotiated on, advertised prices with small print (that alters the same) or just try very hard to hide the pricing altogether<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  I believe that if you&#8217;re confident in your product/service you will have no reason to obfuscate the price (in these and other ways).  If you don&#8217;t have to disguise your price then you are able to place it very prominently on your site.  It turns out to be the same folks prominently <a href="http://www.strongspace.com/plans">displaying</a> <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/signup">their</a> <a href="http://www.dropsend.com/pricingsignup.php">pricing</a> also making it very easy to cancel your account (see now how it links to the previous post?).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m thinking that you have to be pretty confident to offer this level of transparency in your product/service; hence my initial statement.  As a slight aside/addition, most of the services that are following this style (is it coincidence they seem to be web 2.0/agile folks?) also offer free versions of their services which again indicates their confidence.</p>


	<p>Transparency as a buzzword seems to increasing in popularity with the folks at <a href="http://www.riffs.com">riffs</a> even using it to describe their <a href="http://www.riffs.com/doc.cgi?section=privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s probably meaning somewhere in this disjointed ramble but having just re-read it I&#8217;m not so sure.  Maybe I&#8217;ll revisit it at some point, but then again, maybe I wont; we&#8217;ll see.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> This was particularly annoying just recently when I was looking for a new broadband provider.  Of all the websites I visited, I don&#8217;t recall being able to find conclusive pricing on any of them.  Some would quote a monthly price but actually expect a year up front while other&#8217;s might quote a genuine monthly cost but then make it very difficult to find minimum contract terms, and even more difficult to find the cost of breaking those terms.</p>

                <p>It bugs me when I&#8217;m unable to cancel accounts I have for various online services.  I guess that I&#8217;ve possibly become annoyed by it because lots of the <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">more</a> <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">recent</a> (<a href="http://www.blinksale.com">cool</a>) <a href="http://www.strongspace.com">offerings</a> make it very easy to cancel.</p>


	<p>I was initially aiming this rant at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">yahoo</a> as I&#8217;ve had a user there for about seven years (hmm, that seems too long but I&#8217;m pretty certain it&#8217;s correct) and didn&#8217;t think I could cancel it.  It would actually appear that I can cancel it but they still make it relatively difficult to do (go to help, click on article, follow link and then cancel).</p>


	<p>Actually, I just changed the title of the post from <strong>I should be able to close online accounts</strong> to it&#8217;s present form due to the yahoo finding (although I&#8217;m pretty certain there are lots of other services that don&#8217;t allow for cancelling).</p>

                <p>Having got really used to the location of the close button in <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/features/safari/">safari</a> I had problems getting used to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">firefox</a> again.  Luckily, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/authorprofiles.php?application=firefox&#38;id=2318">some kind soul</a> has created an extension called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&#38;id=785">Tab X</a> which basically replicates the safari close button behaviour in firefox, albeit at the opposite side of the tab.  That&#8217;s cool.</p>

                </p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve been aware of, and used periodically, <a href="http://www.tadalists.com">tadalist</a> from <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37 signals</a>.</p>


	<p>Over about the last week I&#8217;ve started to use tadalist far more.  It&#8217;s great but I really want a way to add items without having to use tada each time.  Apparently there <a href="http://www.keeganjones.com/widgets/tada/">used to be</a> a <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/downloads/dashboard/">dashboard</a> widget (which would be handy as I use mac&#8217;s at work) but it&#8217;s been long lost.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;d eventually like to develop a dashboard widget myself but until I get there I wondered about developing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> to achieve similar effect.</p>


	<p>I played around for a bit and came up with the following.</p>


<div class="typocode">
<pre>
var new_item=prompt('Add Item');
location.href='http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/item/add?list_id=LISTID&#38;content='+encodeURIComponent(new_item);
alert('Added');
location.href='http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/lists/show/LISTID';
</pre>
</div>

	<p>It even kinda works, although if you press cancel when it prompts for the list text, it will add a new item of null, obviously&#8230;</p>


	<p>If you really feel the need to try this, just copy this <a href="javascript:var new_item=prompt('Add Item'); location.href = 'http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/item/add?list_id=LIST_ID&#38;content='+encodeURIComponent(new_item); alert('Added'); location.href='http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/lists/show/LIST_ID';">link</a> to your bookmarks.  You will need to replace <span class="caps">USERNAME</span> with your username and <span class="caps">LISTID</span> with the id of the list that you want items to be added to.  To find the id (I&#8217;d suggest creating a new list like &#8216;added from browser&#8217;) click on the relevant list in tada and copy the number from the url after lists/show.</p>


	<p>Oh yeah, you will also need to be logged into tada for this to work, otherwise you get a nasty looking <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/no_page_here">error page</a>.</p>

                <p>Well, having used <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">bloglines</a> <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/10/02/online-news-reader">since</a> the beginning of October, I&#8217;ve just replaced it with <a href="http://www.rojo.com">rojo</a>.  There were a couple of anoyances with bloglines &#8211; the main one being that if you click on a folder, all stories are marked as read.  I realise that you can go through and keep them unread but if you click on a folder that contains <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a> and <a href="http://www.slashdot.com">slashdot</a>, that&#8217;s a lot of clicking when you might not have time right now.</p>


	<p>The main reason for switching to rojo is that it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_surprise">works as I would expect it to work</a>, particularly regarding the way in which stories are marked as read.  It also seems to offer lots of cool tagging/social features that I&#8217;m yet to explore.</p>

                <p>I currently use <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> all day, every day, at <a href="http://www.revieworld.com">work</a>.  It&#8217;s great.</p>


	<p>Now, I don&#8217;t actually know how to use the Ruby debugger; I&#8217;ve taken a look at it in the past and am sure I could use it; it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve never had the need.</p>


	<p>As with lots of things, I&#8217;ve been meaning to take a more detailed look for a while; mainly so that I could say &#8216;I know how to use that&#8217;.  Then, this morning, I realised that maybe it wasn&#8217;t such a bad thing not to know.  If I can develop software that works<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> without the help of the debugger<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> then, unless the need arises, why bother?</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> It works when the tests pass.</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> But very much with the help of unit tests.</p>

                </p>

                <p>I read about this <a href="https://www.pwdhash.com">concept</a> and associated <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1033">firefox plugin</a> a while back but then promptly forgot about it.  I came across it again recently and decided to take a more detailed look.</p>


	<p>Currently, you probably either have&#8230;</p>


	<ol>
	<li>a different password for each website to which you have membership.</li>
		<li>a handful of passwords, some more secure than others depending on the type of websites they are for.</li>
		<li>one password for all of the websites that you are a member of.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>In the first and second instance, purely due to the volume, there&#8217;s a good chance that these passwords are written down somewhere.  This is bad.</p>


	<p>In the third instance, you are opening yourself up to lots of problems if your single password is compromised.</p>


	<p>PwdHash is a solution that allows you to have a different password for each of the websites that you are subscribed to, whilst allowing you to remember just one.  It does this by creating a hash based on your &#8216;password&#8217; and the url of the site you are visiting.</p>


	<p>It is perfectly possible to do this manually and use a desktop app or command line tool to generate the hashed password for a given site.  However, this would be a real pain if you are constantly visiting different sites that require authentication.  The firefox plugin with this service basically takes the pain out of this manual process.  Once installed, just press F2 or enter @@ in a password field and the hashed password will be created before submitting to the site.</p>


	<p>If the plugin doesn&#8217;t work or you are on a shared computer, you can always just use the javascript utility on the pwdhash.com site to generate the same hashed password.</p>


	<p>To summarise, I&#8217;ve installed the plugin and have started changing some of my passwords over to their hashed counterpart.  I&#8217;ve only changed a couple of passwords and haven&#8217;t yet had to use the javascript util but so far it seems pretty good.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m just going to grab a copy of the javascript source and place it <a href="http://www.strongspace.com">some place safe</a> just in case&#8230;</p>

I was initially excited about the promise of this software having read about it in a <a href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/LongTailTriesToWagTheDog">post</a> by <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com">Chad Fowler</a>.  It intends to replace those custom Excel/Access &#8216;applications&#8217; that are so pervasive in organisations of all sizes.</p>


	<p>Today I saw a <a href="http://smallthought.com/blog/?p=13">post</a> on the dabbledb blog containing a link to a movie of the software being used.  Completely initial impression with no real knowledge behind it is that it looks far too complicated to take the market for which it is intended.</p>


	<p>Having said that, I&#8217;ll wait to see more movies and maybe be lucky enough to get to try it in beta before commenting further.</p>

                <p>I saw <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/11/09/orange">this</a> recently and it reminded of a call I had a couple of months ago from <span class="caps">HSBC</span>.  The call came through on an 0845 number and the caller stated that he was from <span class="caps">HSBC</span> and needed some security details before he could talk to me.  I immediately assumed that this was a hoax and wouldn&#8217;t supply the details requested.  He didn&#8217;t actually ask for my password but did request post code, date of birth and mother&#8217;s maiden name.  I asked him what the call was concerning and he said that he couldn&#8217;t tell me before I answered his questions.  I said that I wouldn&#8217;t answer his questions and he started to &#8216;issue me a warning&#8217;.  I hung up.  I then immediately called <span class="caps">HSBC</span>, stating that I&#8217;d received this call and asking if they had any record of it.  The guy I spoke to this time said that it was very possible I&#8217;d been contacted as I&#8217;d gone way over my overdraft limit and there was a note on my account.  Oops.  It made me feel a bit bad for hanging up on the first guy but I&#8217;m still not convinced they should have called in the first place &#8211; a letter would be more appropriate in these days of such prevalent phishing and scamming.  Ho hum.</p>

                <p>I just re-installed Windows XP on my laptop as it has been almost unusable for the last few months due to large amounts of software cruft.  I had a need to read a .pdf and didn&#8217;t really want to install Adobe as it just feels a little too bloaty to me.  A quick google turned this <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">little app</a> up.  It&#8217;s small, feels faster than Acrobat Reader (although that may be to do with the re-install) and is free.  So far so good.</p>

                <p>I went to add a link to my bloglines public feed this morning and couldn&#8217;t log into typo admin.  I double checked that my username and password were correct using the console and so took a look at the accounts controller.  Using some advanced debugging techniques (mmm render :text =&gt; &#8217;&#8217;) I found that request.method was returning :POST where the code was checking for :post.  I amended the controller and all now works.  I&#8217;m just really not sure why it stopped working as nothing had changed!</p>


	<p><strong>Update Sun 6th Nov 14:26</strong></p>


	<p>I originally tried to post this article yesterday but it would appear that the new method in the content controller was also broken &#8211; checking for request.post? was not working as expected.  I&#8217;ve just changed this to request.method == :POST and it now works.  Really not sure what&#8217;s going on though.</p>


	<p><strong>Update Sun 6th Nov 14:40</strong></p>


	<p>Right then, it would appear that the &#8216;method&#8217; method of request had been changed from <code>env['REQUEST_METHOD'].downcase.to_sym</code> to <code>env['REQUEST_METHOD'].to_sym</code>.  This was in actionpack 1.9.1.  Checking the version on my laptop confirms that it should be the downcase variant.  I&#8217;ve now changed it back so will see how it goes.</p>


	<p><strong>Update Mon 7th Nov 08:45</strong></p>


	<p>It would appear that it was actually me that changed the code in request.rb when I was trying to diagnose and fix some problems when installing <a href="http://weed.rbse.com">weed</a>.  Oops.</p>

                <p>This is for <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a> 1.3 with <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com">FastCgi</a>, <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.org">MySql</a> 4 and <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> already installed on <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBsd</a> 4.11 Stable.</p>


<pre>
# svn checkout svn://leetsoft.com/typo/trunk typo
</pre>

	<p>In the public directory, within the newly created typo directory, edit the dispatch.fcgi file, changing the #! (shebang) line to /usr/local/bin/ruby.</p>


	<p>Create a database for the typo install.</p>


<pre>
# mysql
mysql&gt; create database typo;
mysql&gt; quit
</pre>

	<p>Copy the default database.yml.example file in config directory to database.yml.  Edit the file with the mysql credentials for your server.  Ignore (possibly remove) the development and test sections of the config file as these are not required in &#8216;production&#8217;.</p>


	<p>Use the mysql script in the db directory to create database tables.</p>


<pre>
# mysql -Dtypo &lt; db/schema.mysql.sql
</pre>

	<p><strong>NB.</strong> There is a mysql-v3 script as well.  As far as I can tell the only difference is the database engine (InnoDb by default and MyIsam in v3).</p>


	<p>Add a new FastCgiServer to the Apache config (httpd.conf).</p>


<pre>
FastCgiServer /home/web/typo/public/dispatch.fcgi -initial-env RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>

	<p>Add a virtual host for this new site.</p>

                <p>I updated Typo last night to run from svn trunk, just to get the added benefit of pinging sites like <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs</a> and <a href="http://www.technorati.com">technorati</a> whenever I publish an article.  All was running smoothly until I just tried to create the newsreader article.  On saving, I get a not very helpful Rails app error.  The logs didn&#8217;t help an amazing amount either&#8230;</p>


	<p>It was at around this point that I remembered that my shared hosting account didn&#8217;t actually allow for certain low level network access (e.g. <acronym title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</acronym>) from my virtual machine.  Sure enough, disabling the auto-ping option made the error go away.  Having looked a bit further it would appear that the articles were actually being saved but I was seeing the error when the ping request was timing out.  This has already been reported on <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/ticket/400">typo trac</a>.  I must admit I don&#8217;t know the exact cause of the problem here but am guessing that the blog ping&#8217;s require access to some network operation that I don&#8217;t have permissions for&#8230;</p>


	<p><strong><em>update Fri 7th Oct</em></strong></p>


	<p>Mmmm, seems I was being stupid in my assumption.  The &#8216;blog pings&#8217; just transfer data over http, nothing lower than that.  As such, the problem must have been caused by a non-respondent ping server at the time I was trying to save.  In fact, I just created a new test article and enabled the pings and all worked fine.  Oops.</p>

                <p>It&#8217;s been on my list for quite a while to check out online newsreaders in order to replace my flagging <a href="http://www.sharpreader.com">desktop client of choice</a>.</p>


	<p>This has been pushed up the list by my recent contract taking me away from my main machine for the best part of the week.  As such, I spent last night looking at some of the alternatives listed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_aggregators#Online_news_aggregators">this</a> <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a> article.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m currently torn between <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">bloglines</a> and <a href="http://www.bloxor.com">blox0r</a> and although bloxor was slightly ahead last night I&#8217;ve actually been using bloglines more during the day today.</p>


	<p>Blox0r is a <acronym title="XML User interface Language">XUL</acronym> app which means that it only runs in Mozilla browsers (I think).  This provides for a very rich and clean interface which suits me perfectly.  Unfortunately, I&#8217;m just not 100% sure that it&#8217;s doing exactly what I expect it to be doing &#8211; a handful of feeds are not rendering as they should which makes me wonder what else may not be working correctly.  Hence my current persuasion toward bloglines, which although looks a little too &#8216;full featured&#8217; for my needs is at least rendering all of my feeds correctly.</p>


	<p>I also tested the following services last night, none of which seemed to come up to scratch.  Feed lounge actually looks very promising but is currently in a non public alpha so I&#8217;ll have to wait a little longer on that one.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.instiki.org">Instiki</a> quite a bit for storing what are essentially notes.</p>


	<p>Although it&#8217;s been a true <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> app for a while, due to it&#8217;s use of <a href="http://madeleine.sourceforge.net/">Madeleine</a> for object persistence, it required a couple of workarounds to host it using <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">apache</a>.  Namely, run Instiki on <a href="http://www.webrick.org">WEBrick</a> and then use mod_proxy in apache to forward requests for a given url to the webrick server.</p>


	<p>Just a couple of days ago Alexey Verkhovsky (Instiki maintainer) <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/158000">announced</a> that a beta version of Instiki (<a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/6258/instiki-ar-beta1.zip">Instiki-AR</a>) running on <a href="http://ar.rubyonrails.com/">Active Record</a> was available.  This basically means that Instiki can now be run directly via apache using <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/">fast cgi</a>, negating the need for mod_proxy and running in &#8216;production&#8217; on WEBrick.</p>


	<p>I downloaded the beta this morning and had a quick play.  Initially I created a <a href="http://www.mysql.org">MySQL</a> database and ran script/create_db to create the relevant tables in the database.  Everything worked as expected, although I didn&#8217;t actually try to import any existing data.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve read about <a href="http://sqlite.org/">sqlite</a> quite a few times but have never got round to actually playing with it.  As such, I spent a short time getting Instiki-AR to use sqlite as it&#8217;s backend.</p>


	<p>First off, I installed the sqlite3 gem (sqlite3-ruby 1.1.0 (mswin32)).</p>


<div class="typocode">
<pre>
# gem install sqlite3
</pre>
</div>

	<p>This was followed by downloading the <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/sqlitedll-3_2_7.zip">sqlite dll</a> and placing it in a directory in my path environment variable.  This was all that was actually required.</p>


	<p>I used script/create_db to create the database files and tables as with the mysql implementation and everything just worked.</p>


	<p><strong><em>Update 17:30</em></strong></p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve just played a little further and actually imported data from an existing instiki instance to the sqlite database.</p>


	<p>First of all, I created a copy of my original instiki with the madeleine storage in the storage directory.</p>


	<p>In the instiki-ar version I then ran the following (from Alexey&#8217;s original email) to output a sql script that will import all of my wiki content into the database.</p>


<div class="typocode">
<pre>
# ruby script\import_storage -i d:\instiki -t d:\instiki-ar\storage\2500 -o i.sql -d sqlite
</pre>
</div>

	<p>I then downloaded the <a href="http://sqlite.org/sqlite-3_2_7.zip">sqlite3</a> utility to administer sqlite databases.  I placed this in a directory included in my path environment variable.</p>


	<p>Start sqlite3 with the location of the production database as the argument.</p>


<div class="typocode">
<pre>
# sqlite3 db\prod.db
</pre>
</div>

	<p>Execute the i.sql script to import all of the data to sqlite.</p>


<div class="typocode">
<pre>
sqlite&gt; .read i.sql
sqlite&gt; .quit
</pre>
</div>

	<p>That&#8217;s it.  My original wiki content is now in the AR version and everything seems to work great.</p>


	<p><strong>Note</strong> To get instiki-ar from subversion.</p>


<div class="typocode">
<pre>
# svn export --revision 397 http://svn.instiki.org/instiki/branches/instiki-ar/

	<p>Last night I was trying to connect to my home PC remotely via <span class="caps">SSH</span>.  This usually works fine but wasn&#8217;t last night.  I assumed that it was the <span class="caps">ADSL</span> connection at home playing up and gave up for the evening.  On arrival home this morning I found that everything was working as expected (from within the Lan).  I then dialled out and experienced the same problems (not being able to connect remotely).  I tried another dial-up connection (which wasn&#8217;t working last night) and this time the remote access worked fine.  After a few more tests, it appears that by connecting to my <span class="caps">ISP</span> (<a href="http://www.zenadsl.co.uk">Zen</a>) via dial-up using the same account as my <span class="caps">ADSL</span>, my <span class="caps">ADSL</span> Internet connectivity is disrupted.  It doesn&#8217;t actually drop the connection (according to the status on the router), rather just does not transmit/receive any traffic.  Lesson learned &#8211; don&#8217;t use my Zen dial-up account when I am expecting my <span class="caps">ADSL</span> to be active.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m very much <strong>not</strong> a graphical person but when forced to dabble in any kind of image manipulation have always tried to use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The <span class="caps">GIMP</span></a>, over any commercial offerings.</p>


	<p>Just this afternoon I&#8217;ve spent some time trying to make the background of a very simple image transparent.  The image is a filled shape on a white background.  I wanted the white background to be transparent.</p>


	<p>I <em>think</em> I&#8217;ve finally found the best way to achieve this but may be way off mark.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Open the original image (jpeg image in this case).</li>
		<li>Use the &#8216;magic wand&#8217; (Select contiguous regions) and select the coloured shape.</li>
		<li>Move the selected shape to the side of the image.</li>
		<li>In the Layers view you should now have a new &#8216;Floating Selection (Floated Layer)&#8217;.  Right click on this layer and select &#8216;New layer&#8217;.  This converts the transient layer into a real layer.</li>
		<li>Click on the background layer to &#8216;select&#8217; the background of the image.</li>
		<li>Select Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Add Alpha Channel.</li>
		<li>We can now set the background to transparent by using Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Colour to Alpha and selecting our background colour (white in my case) as the From colour.</li>
		<li>Click Ok to set the background to transparent.</li>
		<li>Click on the Floated Layer (this is what the layer will be called unless you renamed it) to display it to the side of the image.</li>
		<li>Click the cross-hair (Move layers &#38; selections) tool and move the shape onto the now transparent background.</li>
		<li>That&#8217;s it, apart from saving the image in a format that either saves the layers (.xcf at least, maybe more) or at least deals with transparency (.gif and .png).</li>
	</ol>


	<p><em><strong>Update 18:07</strong> It seems that anything over and above simple shapes as I had and this practice fails because it&#8217;s not easy to initially cut the &#8216;foreground&#8217; image out.  But then again, maybe that&#8217;s just because I don&#8217;t know how to effectively &#8216;cut&#8217; images&#8230;</em></p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve installed a handful of wireless networks over the years and have always gone for <a href="http://www.netgear.co.uk">Netgear</a> products due to price and my perceived quality of the items.</p>


	<p>I recently had another wireless network to install which was to span a house and an office at the end of the garden.  Having looked at the latest Netgear offerings I decided upon the <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/rangemax_wirelessrouter_wpn824.php"><span class="caps">WPN824</span></a>.  This was mainly due to the boasts of &#8220;Network range extended by up to 400 feet&#8221;.  Although the item was slightly more expensive (£73.91 ex Vat at time of writing<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>) than the alternatives, I was figuring on not having to buy additional antennae for the individual computers and therefore saving that way.  The first problem I had was that I had mis-interpreted the device as an <span class="caps">ADSL</span> router rather than a Broadband router.  Because of this oversight I had to purchase an additional <span class="caps">ADSL</span> Ethernet Modem (<a href="http://netgear.co.uk/wired_adsl_router_dg632.php">Netgear <span class="caps">DG632</span></a>) for £36.45 ex Vat at the time of writing.  This was already going over budget.</p>


	<p>On installation I was greeted with very dissapointing results.  I was using <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/rangemax_wirelesspci_wpn311.php">Netgear <span class="caps">WPN311</span></a> cards in each desktop and the wireless router was placed equidistant from each machine (albeit one had to travel through a couple of walls and the other through open air and wooden divides).</p>


	<p>I tried all of the channels, with and without encryption and selecting the network types (b, g, b &#38; g, 108MB only), all to no avail.  I was getting a signal but not one that was strong and consistent enough to work with.</p>


	<p>The money I thought I was saving by buying the more expensive router was about to disapear with the addition of a <a href="http://solwise.co.uk/wireless-indoorantenna-omni-105os.htm">5db omni-direction antennae</a> for each of the desktop machines.</p>


	<p>With the antennae added, wireless performance was ok, although only really when running at a max of 54Mbs (i.e. I was still not able to take advantage of the 108Mbs speeds).</p>


	<p>I still wasn&#8217;t amazingly happy with this performance and so obtained a <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/wireless_adslrouter_dg834g.php">Netgear <span class="caps">DG834G</span></a> ADSL/Wireless router combo.  This was installed in place of the <span class="caps">WPN824</span>/DG632 pair and to my slight surprise both faster network speeds and better consistency prevailed.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m currently in the process of sending the <span class="caps">WPN824</span>/DG632 units back to eBuyer on the basis that they (well, the <span class="caps">WPN824</span> at least) do not live up to their promises.</p>


	<p>As indicated at the top of the article, I&#8217;m generally pleased with Netgear products but have been let down by the exagerated promises of this particular device.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve always preferred <a href="http://www.tightvnc.com">TightVNC</a> for remote control of other machines.  When run through an <span class="caps">SSH</span> tunnel it provides secure, free, remote access.  The only problem is that it&#8217;s not amazingly easy to talk someone through installing it remotely, what with the need to configure suitable <span class="caps">SSH</span> software, firewall and TightVNC.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.fogcreek.com">Fogcreek</a> <a href="http://www.copilot.com">Copilot</a> offers a commercial solution to this by having both parties communicate via a mediator.  This is fine but I&#8217;m not keen on the cost.</p>


	<p>In a search for a free (potentially open source) alternative I stumbled across <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com">Team Viewer</a>.  I&#8217;ve just tested this over the Internet, connecting two computers, both of which are behind firewalls, and it works fine.</p>


	<p>I then started thinking that if there was a very simple <span class="caps">P2P VPN</span>, we could just use standard TightVNC and get round the cost and difficulty problems.  It turns out that there is a free <span class="caps">P2P VPN</span> in the form of <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc">Hamachi</a>.  Although I&#8217;ve not managed to test this over the Internet I have tested it connecting two different computers on a <span class="caps">LAN</span> (one of which is in VM Ware).  I also managed to successfully get TightVNC working, after opening the relevant port (5900) in the target machine.  For some reason Remote Desktop wouldn&#8217;t work &#8211; it seemed to connect but just left me with a black screen &#8211; but I was happy enough with Tight <span class="caps">VNC</span> anyway.</p>

                <p>I initially had this running on typo 2.5.5 but the flickr integration into the sidebar didn&#8217;t seem to work &#8211; unless I was doing something stupid which is entirely possible.  I applied patches from changesets 596 and 632 to no avail, so decided to export the trunk from svn and try that.  I still have the same problems which is slightly frustrating.  The db migrations built into the admin interface as amazing though.</p>


	<p><i>It would appear that it was my ignorance that was causing the flickr syndication problems.  I wasn&#8217;t entering the feed url correctly.  I&#8217;m wondering though, whether there should be some docs on the format of the feed url &#8211; I had to look at the flickr.rb source to find the format, and then search unrelated websites to find my actual flickr nsid</i>.</p>


	<p><i>Having got the flickr syndication working I&#8217;ve not reverted back to typo stable 2.5.5.</i></p>

                <p>Apparently due to confusion caused by the <a href="http://www.freespire.org/">freespire</a> project, <a href="http://www.linspire.com/">Linspire</a> decided to give away <a href="http://info.linspire.com/freespire/index.html">free copies</a> of their Linux distribution.  I downloaded it the other day and just this morning took a look at it running in &#8216;LiveCD&#8217; mode within VM Ware.  Initial impression is that it&#8217;s trying far too hard to look like Windows and hides far too much from the user.  I guess this is for their target audience but it didn&#8217;t feel right to me.  I may take the time to have a more detailed play in the future.</p>
