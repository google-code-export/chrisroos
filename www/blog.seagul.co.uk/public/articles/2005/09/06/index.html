                <p>I&#8217;ve always preferred <a href="http://www.tightvnc.com">TightVNC</a> for remote control of other machines.  When run through an <span class="caps">SSH</span> tunnel it provides secure, free, remote access.  The only problem is that it&#8217;s not amazingly easy to talk someone through installing it remotely, what with the need to configure suitable <span class="caps">SSH</span> software, firewall and TightVNC.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.fogcreek.com">Fogcreek</a> <a href="http://www.copilot.com">Copilot</a> offers a commercial solution to this by having both parties communicate via a mediator.  This is fine but I&#8217;m not keen on the cost.</p>


	<p>In a search for a free (potentially open source) alternative I stumbled across <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com">Team Viewer</a>.  I&#8217;ve just tested this over the Internet, connecting two computers, both of which are behind firewalls, and it works fine.</p>


	<p>I then started thinking that if there was a very simple <span class="caps">P2P VPN</span>, we could just use standard TightVNC and get round the cost and difficulty problems.  It turns out that there is a free <span class="caps">P2P VPN</span> in the form of <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc">Hamachi</a>.  Although I&#8217;ve not managed to test this over the Internet I have tested it connecting two different computers on a <span class="caps">LAN</span> (one of which is in VM Ware).  I also managed to successfully get TightVNC working, after opening the relevant port (5900) in the target machine.  For some reason Remote Desktop wouldn&#8217;t work &#8211; it seemed to connect but just left me with a black screen &#8211; but I was happy enough with Tight <span class="caps">VNC</span> anyway.</p>

                <p>I initially had this running on typo 2.5.5 but the flickr integration into the sidebar didn&#8217;t seem to work &#8211; unless I was doing something stupid which is entirely possible.  I applied patches from changesets 596 and 632 to no avail, so decided to export the trunk from svn and try that.  I still have the same problems which is slightly frustrating.  The db migrations built into the admin interface as amazing though.</p>


	<p><i>It would appear that it was my ignorance that was causing the flickr syndication problems.  I wasn&#8217;t entering the feed url correctly.  I&#8217;m wondering though, whether there should be some docs on the format of the feed url &#8211; I had to look at the flickr.rb source to find the format, and then search unrelated websites to find my actual flickr nsid</i>.</p>


	<p><i>Having got the flickr syndication working I&#8217;ve not reverted back to typo stable 2.5.5.</i></p>

                <p>Apparently due to confusion caused by the <a href="http://www.freespire.org/">freespire</a> project, <a href="http://www.linspire.com/">Linspire</a> decided to give away <a href="http://info.linspire.com/freespire/index.html">free copies</a> of their Linux distribution.  I downloaded it the other day and just this morning took a look at it running in &#8216;LiveCD&#8217; mode within VM Ware.  Initial impression is that it&#8217;s trying far too hard to look like Windows and hides far too much from the user.  I guess this is for their target audience but it didn&#8217;t feel right to me.  I may take the time to have a more detailed play in the future.</p>
