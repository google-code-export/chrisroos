                <p>This may be obvious to others&#8230;</p>


	<p>Last night I was trying to connect to my home PC remotely via <span class="caps">SSH</span>.  This usually works fine but wasn&#8217;t last night.  I assumed that it was the <span class="caps">ADSL</span> connection at home playing up and gave up for the evening.  On arrival home this morning I found that everything was working as expected (from within the Lan).  I then dialled out and experienced the same problems (not being able to connect remotely).  I tried another dial-up connection (which wasn&#8217;t working last night) and this time the remote access worked fine.  After a few more tests, it appears that by connecting to my <span class="caps">ISP</span> (<a href="http://www.zenadsl.co.uk">Zen</a>) via dial-up using the same account as my <span class="caps">ADSL</span>, my <span class="caps">ADSL</span> Internet connectivity is disrupted.  It doesn&#8217;t actually drop the connection (according to the status on the router), rather just does not transmit/receive any traffic.  Lesson learned &#8211; don&#8217;t use my Zen dial-up account when I am expecting my <span class="caps">ADSL</span> to be active.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m very much <strong>not</strong> a graphical person but when forced to dabble in any kind of image manipulation have always tried to use <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The <span class="caps">GIMP</span></a>, over any commercial offerings.</p>


	<p>Just this afternoon I&#8217;ve spent some time trying to make the background of a very simple image transparent.  The image is a filled shape on a white background.  I wanted the white background to be transparent.</p>


	<p>I <em>think</em> I&#8217;ve finally found the best way to achieve this but may be way off mark.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Open the original image (jpeg image in this case).</li>
		<li>Use the &#8216;magic wand&#8217; (Select contiguous regions) and select the coloured shape.</li>
		<li>Move the selected shape to the side of the image.</li>
		<li>In the Layers view you should now have a new &#8216;Floating Selection (Floated Layer)&#8217;.  Right click on this layer and select &#8216;New layer&#8217;.  This converts the transient layer into a real layer.</li>
		<li>Click on the background layer to &#8216;select&#8217; the background of the image.</li>
		<li>Select Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Add Alpha Channel.</li>
		<li>We can now set the background to transparent by using Layer &gt; Transparency &gt; Colour to Alpha and selecting our background colour (white in my case) as the From colour.</li>
		<li>Click Ok to set the background to transparent.</li>
		<li>Click on the Floated Layer (this is what the layer will be called unless you renamed it) to display it to the side of the image.</li>
		<li>Click the cross-hair (Move layers &#38; selections) tool and move the shape onto the now transparent background.</li>
		<li>That&#8217;s it, apart from saving the image in a format that either saves the layers (.xcf at least, maybe more) or at least deals with transparency (.gif and .png).</li>
	</ol>


	<p><em><strong>Update 18:07</strong> It seems that anything over and above simple shapes as I had and this practice fails because it&#8217;s not easy to initially cut the &#8216;foreground&#8217; image out.  But then again, maybe that&#8217;s just because I don&#8217;t know how to effectively &#8216;cut&#8217; images&#8230;</em></p>

                </p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve installed a handful of wireless networks over the years and have always gone for <a href="http://www.netgear.co.uk">Netgear</a> products due to price and my perceived quality of the items.</p>


	<p>I recently had another wireless network to install which was to span a house and an office at the end of the garden.  Having looked at the latest Netgear offerings I decided upon the <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/rangemax_wirelessrouter_wpn824.php"><span class="caps">WPN824</span></a>.  This was mainly due to the boasts of &#8220;Network range extended by up to 400 feet&#8221;.  Although the item was slightly more expensive (£73.91 ex Vat at time of writing<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>) than the alternatives, I was figuring on not having to buy additional antennae for the individual computers and therefore saving that way.  The first problem I had was that I had mis-interpreted the device as an <span class="caps">ADSL</span> router rather than a Broadband router.  Because of this oversight I had to purchase an additional <span class="caps">ADSL</span> Ethernet Modem (<a href="http://netgear.co.uk/wired_adsl_router_dg632.php">Netgear <span class="caps">DG632</span></a>) for £36.45 ex Vat at the time of writing.  This was already going over budget.</p>


	<p>On installation I was greeted with very dissapointing results.  I was using <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/rangemax_wirelesspci_wpn311.php">Netgear <span class="caps">WPN311</span></a> cards in each desktop and the wireless router was placed equidistant from each machine (albeit one had to travel through a couple of walls and the other through open air and wooden divides).</p>


	<p>I tried all of the channels, with and without encryption and selecting the network types (b, g, b &#38; g, 108MB only), all to no avail.  I was getting a signal but not one that was strong and consistent enough to work with.</p>


	<p>The money I thought I was saving by buying the more expensive router was about to disapear with the addition of a <a href="http://solwise.co.uk/wireless-indoorantenna-omni-105os.htm">5db omni-direction antennae</a> for each of the desktop machines.</p>


	<p>With the antennae added, wireless performance was ok, although only really when running at a max of 54Mbs (i.e. I was still not able to take advantage of the 108Mbs speeds).</p>


	<p>I still wasn&#8217;t amazingly happy with this performance and so obtained a <a href="http://netgear.co.uk/wireless_adslrouter_dg834g.php">Netgear <span class="caps">DG834G</span></a> ADSL/Wireless router combo.  This was installed in place of the <span class="caps">WPN824</span>/DG632 pair and to my slight surprise both faster network speeds and better consistency prevailed.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m currently in the process of sending the <span class="caps">WPN824</span>/DG632 units back to eBuyer on the basis that they (well, the <span class="caps">WPN824</span> at least) do not live up to their promises.</p>


	<p>As indicated at the top of the article, I&#8217;m generally pleased with Netgear products but have been let down by the exagerated promises of this particular device.</p>


	<p>Mini-disclaimer: This is based only on my experience with the product.  Your experience may vary.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve always preferred <a href="http://www.tightvnc.com">TightVNC</a> for remote control of other machines.  When run through an <span class="caps">SSH</span> tunnel it provides secure, free, remote access.  The only problem is that it&#8217;s not amazingly easy to talk someone through installing it remotely, what with the need to configure suitable <span class="caps">SSH</span> software, firewall and TightVNC.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.fogcreek.com">Fogcreek</a> <a href="http://www.copilot.com">Copilot</a> offers a commercial solution to this by having both parties communicate via a mediator.  This is fine but I&#8217;m not keen on the cost.</p>


	<p>In a search for a free (potentially open source) alternative I stumbled across <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com">Team Viewer</a>.  I&#8217;ve just tested this over the Internet, connecting two computers, both of which are behind firewalls, and it works fine.</p>


	<p>I then started thinking that if there was a very simple <span class="caps">P2P VPN</span>, we could just use standard TightVNC and get round the cost and difficulty problems.  It turns out that there is a free <span class="caps">P2P VPN</span> in the form of <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc">Hamachi</a>.  Although I&#8217;ve not managed to test this over the Internet I have tested it connecting two different computers on a <span class="caps">LAN</span> (one of which is in VM Ware).  I also managed to successfully get TightVNC working, after opening the relevant port (5900) in the target machine.  For some reason Remote Desktop wouldn&#8217;t work &#8211; it seemed to connect but just left me with a black screen &#8211; but I was happy enough with Tight <span class="caps">VNC</span> anyway.</p>

                <p>I initially had this running on typo 2.5.5 but the flickr integration into the sidebar didn&#8217;t seem to work &#8211; unless I was doing something stupid which is entirely possible.  I applied patches from changesets 596 and 632 to no avail, so decided to export the trunk from svn and try that.  I still have the same problems which is slightly frustrating.  The db migrations built into the admin interface as amazing though.</p>


	<p><i>It would appear that it was my ignorance that was causing the flickr syndication problems.  I wasn&#8217;t entering the feed url correctly.  I&#8217;m wondering though, whether there should be some docs on the format of the feed url &#8211; I had to look at the flickr.rb source to find the format, and then search unrelated websites to find my actual flickr nsid</i>.</p>


	<p><i>Having got the flickr syndication working I&#8217;ve not reverted back to typo stable 2.5.5.</i></p>

                <p>Apparently due to confusion caused by the <a href="http://www.freespire.org/">freespire</a> project, <a href="http://www.linspire.com/">Linspire</a> decided to give away <a href="http://info.linspire.com/freespire/index.html">free copies</a> of their Linux distribution.  I downloaded it the other day and just this morning took a look at it running in &#8216;LiveCD&#8217; mode within VM Ware.  Initial impression is that it&#8217;s trying far too hard to look like Windows and hides far too much from the user.  I guess this is for their target audience but it didn&#8217;t feel right to me.  I may take the time to have a more detailed play in the future.</p>
