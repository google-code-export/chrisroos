                <p>As <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/18/pwdhash">mentioned previously</a> I&#8217;ve started migrating my online accounts to use <a href="http://www.pwdhash.com">pwdhash</a>  Yesterday was the turn of <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk">ticketmaster</a>.  Well, it turns out their maximum password length is 12 characters.  My key (let alone hashed password) is greater than 12 characters so I&#8217;ve had to leave it as it was, negating the security and convenience of using pwdhash.  There is absolutely no reason ever (at least not that I can think of ;-)) to impose this limit on a password.</p>

                <p>I spent from about 09:30 until 15:00 yesterday trying to get some graphics software talking to two output devices (basically printers) on Windows.</p>


	<p>On arrival, it kinda worked, although not as requested.  There were some additional problems that needed to be sorted too.</p>


	<p>I managed to go from a working state to a non-working state very quickly (great) and then had to spend several hours trying to return it.  In the end, I had one of the connected machines talking correctly but couldn&#8217;t for the life of me work out the other one.</p>


	<p>I found myself trying to diagnose the problem (complaints of missing driver files / mis-communication between ports) using several (very good) utilities from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com">sys internals</a>.  Indeed these did help to a certain extent but it was not easy.</p>


	<p>Coming from a development perspective where every little change is registered in version control, it got me to thinking.  If the changes to an operating system were version controlled I&#8217;d be able to see exactly what changed during every &#8216;upgrade&#8217; to the OS, making it potentially easier to spot the cause of a problem and far easier to roll back to a working state.</p>


	<p>I know that Windows XP (which this machine was running) offers a kind of &#8216;rollback&#8217; functionality; but, to be honest, I don&#8217;t trust it in the slightest; hence not using it.</p>


	<p>Mmm, I think I might install a fresh copy of XP, add all files to version control (which I guess might not even work), change something and then diff between the versions.  I can already think of problems when diffing registry files as they are in binary format so it will not be easy to see differences.. Although, I guess it wouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to store registry files in a text format, i.e. customize the version control somehow.  Just an idea.</p>

                <p>This started out as a few paragraphs at the end of the <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/26/it-should-be-easy-to-cancel-online-accounts">previous post</a> but I thought it better suited on it&#8217;s own.</p>


	<p>In my current thinking, I basically equate transparency with confidence.  Traditionally, people don&#8217;t tell you how much things cost (a sweeping statement I know).  They may have example prices that can be negotiated on, advertised prices with small print (that alters the same) or just try very hard to hide the pricing altogether<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  I believe that if you&#8217;re confident in your product/service you will have no reason to obfuscate the price (in these and other ways).  If you don&#8217;t have to disguise your price then you are able to place it very prominently on your site.  It turns out to be the same folks prominently <a href="http://www.strongspace.com/plans">displaying</a> <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/signup">their</a> <a href="http://www.dropsend.com/pricingsignup.php">pricing</a> also making it very easy to cancel your account (see now how it links to the previous post?).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m thinking that you have to be pretty confident to offer this level of transparency in your product/service; hence my initial statement.  As a slight aside/addition, most of the services that are following this style (is it coincidence they seem to be web 2.0/agile folks?) also offer free versions of their services which again indicates their confidence.</p>


	<p>Transparency as a buzzword seems to increasing in popularity with the folks at <a href="http://www.riffs.com">riffs</a> even using it to describe their <a href="http://www.riffs.com/doc.cgi?section=privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s probably meaning somewhere in this disjointed ramble but having just re-read it I&#8217;m not so sure.  Maybe I&#8217;ll revisit it at some point, but then again, maybe I wont; we&#8217;ll see.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> This was particularly annoying just recently when I was looking for a new broadband provider.  Of all the websites I visited, I don&#8217;t recall being able to find conclusive pricing on any of them.  Some would quote a monthly price but actually expect a year up front while other&#8217;s might quote a genuine monthly cost but then make it very difficult to find minimum contract terms, and even more difficult to find the cost of breaking those terms.</p>

                <p>It bugs me when I&#8217;m unable to cancel accounts I have for various online services.  I guess that I&#8217;ve possibly become annoyed by it because lots of the <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">more</a> <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">recent</a> (<a href="http://www.blinksale.com">cool</a>) <a href="http://www.strongspace.com">offerings</a> make it very easy to cancel.</p>


	<p>I was initially aiming this rant at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">yahoo</a> as I&#8217;ve had a user there for about seven years (hmm, that seems too long but I&#8217;m pretty certain it&#8217;s correct) and didn&#8217;t think I could cancel it.  It would actually appear that I can cancel it but they still make it relatively difficult to do (go to help, click on article, follow link and then cancel).</p>


	<p>Actually, I just changed the title of the post from <strong>I should be able to close online accounts</strong> to it&#8217;s present form due to the yahoo finding (although I&#8217;m pretty certain there are lots of other services that don&#8217;t allow for cancelling).</p>

                <p>Having got really used to the location of the close button in <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/features/safari/">safari</a> I had problems getting used to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">firefox</a> again.  Luckily, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/authorprofiles.php?application=firefox&#38;id=2318">some kind soul</a> has created an extension called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&#38;id=785">Tab X</a> which basically replicates the safari close button behaviour in firefox, albeit at the opposite side of the tab.  That&#8217;s cool.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve been aware of, and used periodically, <a href="http://www.tadalists.com">tadalist</a> from <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37 signals</a>.</p>


	<p>Over about the last week I&#8217;ve started to use tadalist far more.  It&#8217;s great but I really want a way to add items without having to use tada each time.  Apparently there <a href="http://www.keeganjones.com/widgets/tada/">used to be</a> a <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/downloads/dashboard/">dashboard</a> widget (which would be handy as I use mac&#8217;s at work) but it&#8217;s been long lost.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;d eventually like to develop a dashboard widget myself but until I get there I wondered about developing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> to achieve similar effect.</p>


	<p>I played around for a bit and came up with the following.</p>


<div class="typocode">
<pre>
var new_item=prompt('Add Item');
location.href='http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/item/add?list_id=LISTID&#38;content='+encodeURIComponent(new_item);
alert('Added');
location.href='http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/lists/show/LISTID';
</pre>
</div>

	<p>It even kinda works, although if you press cancel when it prompts for the list text, it will add a new item of null, obviously&#8230;</p>


	<p>If you really feel the need to try this, just copy this <a href="javascript:var new_item=prompt('Add Item'); location.href = 'http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/item/add?list_id=LIST_ID&#38;content='+encodeURIComponent(new_item); alert('Added'); location.href='http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/lists/show/LIST_ID';">link</a> to your bookmarks.  You will need to replace <span class="caps">USERNAME</span> with your username and <span class="caps">LISTID</span> with the id of the list that you want items to be added to.  To find the id (I&#8217;d suggest creating a new list like &#8216;added from browser&#8217;) click on the relevant list in tada and copy the number from the url after lists/show.</p>


	<p>Oh yeah, you will also need to be logged into tada for this to work, otherwise you get a nasty looking <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/no_page_here">error page</a>.</p>

                <p>Well, having used <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">bloglines</a> <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/10/02/online-news-reader">since</a> the beginning of October, I&#8217;ve just replaced it with <a href="http://www.rojo.com">rojo</a>.  There were a couple of anoyances with bloglines &#8211; the main one being that if you click on a folder, all stories are marked as read.  I realise that you can go through and keep them unread but if you click on a folder that contains <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a> and <a href="http://www.slashdot.com">slashdot</a>, that&#8217;s a lot of clicking when you might not have time right now.</p>


	<p>The main reason for switching to rojo is that it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_surprise">works as I would expect it to work</a>, particularly regarding the way in which stories are marked as read.  It also seems to offer lots of cool tagging/social features that I&#8217;m yet to explore.</p>

                <p>I currently use <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> all day, every day, at <a href="http://www.revieworld.com">work</a>.  It&#8217;s great.</p>


	<p>Now, I don&#8217;t actually know how to use the Ruby debugger; I&#8217;ve taken a look at it in the past and am sure I could use it; it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve never had the need.</p>


	<p>As with lots of things, I&#8217;ve been meaning to take a more detailed look for a while; mainly so that I could say &#8216;I know how to use that&#8217;.  Then, this morning, I realised that maybe it wasn&#8217;t such a bad thing not to know.  If I can develop software that works<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> without the help of the debugger<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> then, unless the need arises, why bother?</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> It works when the tests pass.</p>


	<p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> But very much with the help of unit tests.</p>

                <p>I read about this <a href="https://www.pwdhash.com">concept</a> and associated <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1033">firefox plugin</a> a while back but then promptly forgot about it.  I came across it again recently and decided to take a more detailed look.</p>


	<p>Currently, you probably either have&#8230;</p>


	<ol>
	<li>a different password for each website to which you have membership.</li>
		<li>a handful of passwords, some more secure than others depending on the type of websites they are for.</li>
		<li>one password for all of the websites that you are a member of.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>In the first and second instance, purely due to the volume, there&#8217;s a good chance that these passwords are written down somewhere.  This is bad.</p>


	<p>In the third instance, you are opening yourself up to lots of problems if your single password is compromised.</p>


	<p>PwdHash is a solution that allows you to have a different password for each of the websites that you are subscribed to, whilst allowing you to remember just one.  It does this by creating a hash based on your &#8216;password&#8217; and the url of the site you are visiting.</p>


	<p>It is perfectly possible to do this manually and use a desktop app or command line tool to generate the hashed password for a given site.  However, this would be a real pain if you are constantly visiting different sites that require authentication.  The firefox plugin with this service basically takes the pain out of this manual process.  Once installed, just press F2 or enter @@ in a password field and the hashed password will be created before submitting to the site.</p>


	<p>If the plugin doesn&#8217;t work or you are on a shared computer, you can always just use the javascript utility on the pwdhash.com site to generate the same hashed password.</p>


	<p>To summarise, I&#8217;ve installed the plugin and have started changing some of my passwords over to their hashed counterpart.  I&#8217;ve only changed a couple of passwords and haven&#8217;t yet had to use the javascript util but so far it seems pretty good.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m just going to grab a copy of the javascript source and place it <a href="http://www.strongspace.com">some place safe</a> just in case&#8230;</p>

I was initially excited about the promise of this software having read about it in a <a href="http://chadfowler.com/index.cgi/Computing/LongTailTriesToWagTheDog">post</a> by <a href="http://www.chadfowler.com">Chad Fowler</a>.  It intends to replace those custom Excel/Access &#8216;applications&#8217; that are so pervasive in organisations of all sizes.</p>


	<p>Today I saw a <a href="http://smallthought.com/blog/?p=13">post</a> on the dabbledb blog containing a link to a movie of the software being used.  Completely initial impression with no real knowledge behind it is that it looks far too complicated to take the market for which it is intended.</p>


	<p>Having said that, I&#8217;ll wait to see more movies and maybe be lucky enough to get to try it in beta before commenting further.</p>

                <p>I saw <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/11/09/orange">this</a> recently and it reminded of a call I had a couple of months ago from <span class="caps">HSBC</span>.  The call came through on an 0845 number and the caller stated that he was from <span class="caps">HSBC</span> and needed some security details before he could talk to me.  I immediately assumed that this was a hoax and wouldn&#8217;t supply the details requested.  He didn&#8217;t actually ask for my password but did request post code, date of birth and mother&#8217;s maiden name.  I asked him what the call was concerning and he said that he couldn&#8217;t tell me before I answered his questions.  I said that I wouldn&#8217;t answer his questions and he started to &#8216;issue me a warning&#8217;.  I hung up.  I then immediately called <span class="caps">HSBC</span>, stating that I&#8217;d received this call and asking if they had any record of it.  The guy I spoke to this time said that it was very possible I&#8217;d been contacted as I&#8217;d gone way over my overdraft limit and there was a note on my account.  Oops.  It made me feel a bit bad for hanging up on the first guy but I&#8217;m still not convinced they should have called in the first place &#8211; a letter would be more appropriate in these days of such prevalent phishing and scamming.  Ho hum.</p>

                <p>I just re-installed Windows XP on my laptop as it has been almost unusable for the last few months due to large amounts of software cruft.  I had a need to read a .pdf and didn&#8217;t really want to install Adobe as it just feels a little too bloaty to me.  A quick google turned this <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">little app</a> up.  It&#8217;s small, feels faster than Acrobat Reader (although that may be to do with the re-install) and is free.  So far so good.</p>

                <p>I just signed up at <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">remeber the milk</a> to test out the beta service.  The signup form is the best I&#8217;ve come across &#8211; period.</p>

                <p>I went to add a link to my bloglines public feed this morning and couldn&#8217;t log into typo admin.  I double checked that my username and password were correct using the console and so took a look at the accounts controller.  Using some advanced debugging techniques (mmm render :text =&gt; &#8217;&#8217;) I found that request.method was returning :POST where the code was checking for :post.  I amended the controller and all now works.  I&#8217;m just really not sure why it stopped working as nothing had changed!</p>


	<p><strong>Update Sun 6th Nov 14:26</strong></p>


	<p>I originally tried to post this article yesterday but it would appear that the new method in the content controller was also broken &#8211; checking for request.post? was not working as expected.  I&#8217;ve just changed this to request.method == :POST and it now works.  Really not sure what&#8217;s going on though.</p>


	<p><strong>Update Sun 6th Nov 14:40</strong></p>


	<p>Right then, it would appear that the &#8216;method&#8217; method of request had been changed from <code>env['REQUEST_METHOD'].downcase.to_sym</code> to <code>env['REQUEST_METHOD'].to_sym</code>.  This was in actionpack 1.9.1.  Checking the version on my laptop confirms that it should be the downcase variant.  I&#8217;ve now changed it back so will see how it goes.</p>


	<p><strong>Update Mon 7th Nov 08:45</strong></p>


	<p>It would appear that it was actually me that changed the code in request.rb when I was trying to diagnose and fix some problems when installing <a href="http://weed.rbse.com">weed</a>.  Oops.</p>
