                <p>This started out as a few paragraphs at the end of the <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/26/it-should-be-easy-to-cancel-online-accounts">previous post</a> but I thought it better suited on it&#8217;s own.</p>


	<p>In my current thinking, I basically equate transparency with confidence.  Traditionally, people don&#8217;t tell you how much things cost (a sweeping statement I know).  They may have example prices that can be negotiated on, advertised prices with small print (that alters the same) or just try very hard to hide the pricing altogether<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  I believe that if you&#8217;re confident in your product/service you will have no reason to obfuscate the price (in these and other ways).  If you don&#8217;t have to disguise your price then you are able to place it very prominently on your site.  It turns out to be the same folks prominently <a href="http://www.strongspace.com/plans">displaying</a> <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/signup">their</a> <a href="http://www.dropsend.com/pricingsignup.php">pricing</a> also making it very easy to cancel your account (see now how it links to the previous post?).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m thinking that you have to be pretty confident to offer this level of transparency in your product/service; hence my initial statement.  As a slight aside/addition, most of the services that are following this style (is it coincidence they seem to be web 2.0/agile folks?) also offer free versions of their services which again indicates their confidence.</p>


	<p>Transparency as a buzzword seems to increasing in popularity with the folks at <a href="http://www.riffs.com">riffs</a> even using it to describe their <a href="http://www.riffs.com/doc.cgi?section=privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s probably meaning somewhere in this disjointed ramble but having just re-read it I&#8217;m not so sure.  Maybe I&#8217;ll revisit it at some point, but then again, maybe I wont; we&#8217;ll see.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> This was particularly annoying just recently when I was looking for a new broadband provider.  Of all the websites I visited, I don&#8217;t recall being able to find conclusive pricing on any of them.  Some would quote a monthly price but actually expect a year up front while other&#8217;s might quote a genuine monthly cost but then make it very difficult to find minimum contract terms, and even more difficult to find the cost of breaking those terms.</p>

                <p>It bugs me when I&#8217;m unable to cancel accounts I have for various online services.  I guess that I&#8217;ve possibly become annoyed by it because lots of the <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">more</a> <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">recent</a> (<a href="http://www.blinksale.com">cool</a>) <a href="http://www.strongspace.com">offerings</a> make it very easy to cancel.</p>


	<p>I was initially aiming this rant at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">yahoo</a> as I&#8217;ve had a user there for about seven years (hmm, that seems too long but I&#8217;m pretty certain it&#8217;s correct) and didn&#8217;t think I could cancel it.  It would actually appear that I can cancel it but they still make it relatively difficult to do (go to help, click on article, follow link and then cancel).</p>


	<p>Actually, I just changed the title of the post from <strong>I should be able to close online accounts</strong> to it&#8217;s present form due to the yahoo finding (although I&#8217;m pretty certain there are lots of other services that don&#8217;t allow for cancelling).</p>

                <p>Having got really used to the location of the close button in <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/macosx/features/safari/">safari</a> I had problems getting used to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">firefox</a> again.  Luckily, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/authorprofiles.php?application=firefox&#38;id=2318">some kind soul</a> has created an extension called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&#38;id=785">Tab X</a> which basically replicates the safari close button behaviour in firefox, albeit at the opposite side of the tab.  That&#8217;s cool.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve been aware of, and used periodically, <a href="http://www.tadalists.com">tadalist</a> from <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37 signals</a>.</p>


	<p>Over about the last week I&#8217;ve started to use tadalist far more.  It&#8217;s great but I really want a way to add items without having to use tada each time.  Apparently there <a href="http://www.keeganjones.com/widgets/tada/">used to be</a> a <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/downloads/dashboard/">dashboard</a> widget (which would be handy as I use mac&#8217;s at work) but it&#8217;s been long lost.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;d eventually like to develop a dashboard widget myself but until I get there I wondered about developing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> to achieve similar effect.</p>


	<p>I played around for a bit and came up with the following.</p>


<div class="typocode">
<pre>
var new_item=prompt('Add Item');
location.href='http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/item/add?list_id=LISTID&#38;content='+encodeURIComponent(new_item);
alert('Added');
location.href='http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/lists/show/LISTID';
</pre>
</div>

	<p>It even kinda works, although if you press cancel when it prompts for the list text, it will add a new item of null, obviously&#8230;</p>


	<p>If you really feel the need to try this, just copy this <a href="javascript:var new_item=prompt('Add Item'); location.href = 'http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/item/add?list_id=LIST_ID&#38;content='+encodeURIComponent(new_item); alert('Added'); location.href='http://USERNAME.tadalist.com/lists/show/LIST_ID';">link</a> to your bookmarks.  You will need to replace <span class="caps">USERNAME</span> with your username and <span class="caps">LISTID</span> with the id of the list that you want items to be added to.  To find the id (I&#8217;d suggest creating a new list like &#8216;added from browser&#8217;) click on the relevant list in tada and copy the number from the url after lists/show.</p>


	<p>Oh yeah, you will also need to be logged into tada for this to work, otherwise you get a nasty looking <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/no_page_here">error page</a>.</p>

                <p>Well, having used <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">bloglines</a> <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/10/02/online-news-reader">since</a> the beginning of October, I&#8217;ve just replaced it with <a href="http://www.rojo.com">rojo</a>.  There were a couple of anoyances with bloglines &#8211; the main one being that if you click on a folder, all stories are marked as read.  I realise that you can go through and keep them unread but if you click on a folder that contains <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a> and <a href="http://www.slashdot.com">slashdot</a>, that&#8217;s a lot of clicking when you might not have time right now.</p>


	<p>The main reason for switching to rojo is that it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_surprise">works as I would expect it to work</a>, particularly regarding the way in which stories are marked as read.  It also seems to offer lots of cool tagging/social features that I&#8217;m yet to explore.</p>
