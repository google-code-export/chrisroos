            <p>I went to add a link to my bloglines public feed this morning and couldn&#8217;t log into typo admin.  I double checked that my username and password were correct using the console and so took a look at the accounts controller.  Using some advanced debugging techniques (mmm render :text =&gt; &#8217;&#8217;) I found that request.method was returning :POST where the code was checking for :post.  I amended the controller and all now works.  I&#8217;m just really not sure why it stopped working as nothing had changed!</p>


	<p><strong>Update Sun 6th Nov 14:26</strong></p>


	<p>I originally tried to post this article yesterday but it would appear that the new method in the content controller was also broken &#8211; checking for request.post? was not working as expected.  I&#8217;ve just changed this to request.method == :POST and it now works.  Really not sure what&#8217;s going on though.</p>


	<p><strong>Update Sun 6th Nov 14:40</strong></p>


	<p>Right then, it would appear that the &#8216;method&#8217; method of request had been changed from <code>env['REQUEST_METHOD'].downcase.to_sym</code> to <code>env['REQUEST_METHOD'].to_sym</code>.  This was in actionpack 1.9.1.  Checking the version on my laptop confirms that it should be the downcase variant.  I&#8217;ve now changed it back so will see how it goes.</p>


	<p><strong>Update Mon 7th Nov 08:45</strong></p>


	<p>It would appear that it was actually me that changed the code in request.rb when I was trying to diagnose and fix some problems when installing <a href="http://weed.rbse.com">weed</a>.  Oops.</p>
