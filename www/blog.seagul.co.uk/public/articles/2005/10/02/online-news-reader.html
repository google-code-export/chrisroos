              <p>It&#8217;s been on my list for quite a while to check out online newsreaders in order to replace my flagging <a href="http://www.sharpreader.com">desktop client of choice</a>.</p>


	<p>This has been pushed up the list by my recent contract taking me away from my main machine for the best part of the week.  As such, I spent last night looking at some of the alternatives listed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_aggregators#Online_news_aggregators">this</a> <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a> article.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m currently torn between <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">bloglines</a> and <a href="http://www.bloxor.com">blox0r</a> and although bloxor was slightly ahead last night I&#8217;ve actually been using bloglines more during the day today.</p>


	<p>Blox0r is a <acronym title="XML User interface Language">XUL</acronym> app which means that it only runs in Mozilla browsers (I think).  This provides for a very rich and clean interface which suits me perfectly.  Unfortunately, I&#8217;m just not 100% sure that it&#8217;s doing exactly what I expect it to be doing &#8211; a handful of feeds are not rendering as they should which makes me wonder what else may not be working correctly.  Hence my current persuasion toward bloglines, which although looks a little too &#8216;full featured&#8217; for my needs is at least rendering all of my feeds correctly.</p>


	<p>I also tested the following services last night, none of which seemed to come up to scratch.  Feed lounge actually looks very promising but is currently in a non public alpha so I&#8217;ll have to wait a little longer on that one.</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://reader.bloogz.com">bloogz</a> &#8211; no opml import</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.newsgator.com">newsgator</a> &#8211; maybe too &#8216;commercial&#8217; looking</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.2rss.com">2rss</a> &#8211; too complicated, didn&#8217;t actually know what to do</li>
		<li><a href="http://beanrocket.com">bean rocket</a> &#8211; didn&#8217;t import opml</li>
		<li><a href="http://feed-tank.com">feed-tank</a> &#8211; rails, no categories, didn&#8217;t import correctly</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.newsisfree.com">news is free</a> &#8211; slightly too complicated</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.rss-feed.org">rss-feed</a> &#8211; no opml import</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.rssfreaks.com">rss freaks</a> &#8211; no opml import</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.waggr.com">waggr</a> &#8211; pretty good, slight interface problems, import opml but no categories</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.feedlounge.com">feed lounge</a> &#8211; looks good, still in alpha.</li>

                    <p>&#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML"><span class="caps">OPML</span></a> is an <span class="caps">XML</span> format for outlines&#8217;.  It would appear that it is, currently, most commonly used to exchange lists of <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds.  That is certainly the context in which I was using it &#8211; to describe the ability to export a list of <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds from one feed reading application (in my case <a href="http://www.sharpreader.com">Sharpreader</a>) to an online alternative.</p>
