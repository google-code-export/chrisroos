                </p>

                <p>A while back I <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/07/24/train-times-by-sms-or-improving-national-rail-enquiries">hacked</a> a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service"><span class="caps">SMS</span></a> interface onto the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">national rail enquiries</a> website.  It turned out to be more gimmicky than functional and I left it to die.  Over the past couple of weeks I&#8217;ve found myself, once again, in need of such a service and so spent a couple of hours last night reviving it: making it work, making it simpler and tidying the code.  The previous interface required the source station and destination station as well as the date and time of travel.  The format was very strict (requiring you to use the unique three digit station codes) and, as I found, overly complex (I could never remember what it was).  All I really wanted to do was specify the source and destination stations and get a list of the next few departures/arrival times.</p>


	<p>The new interface is simply in the format of <span class="caps">SOURCE</span>_STATION to <span class="caps">DESTINATION</span>_STATION.  So, to find the next few trains from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate_railway_station">Ramsgate</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_East_railway_station">London Waterloo East</a> we can send the following <a href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&#38;id=15">direct message</a> to the <a href="http://twitter.com/natrailenq">natrailenq</a> user on <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a></p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">d natrailenq ramsgate to london waterloo east</code></pre></div>

	<p>Although you can now use the full station name it will only, currently, work if you know the exact name of the station (so, waterloo east wouldn&#8217;t work in that above example, but london waterloo east will).  It will still work if you supply the three digit station code.</p>


	<p>In order to use this service, you will need to create a twitter account, <a href="http://twitter.com/help/follow">follow</a> the natrailenq user and enable <span class="caps">SMS</span> notifications from natrailenq.</p>

                </p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve created another <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox">firefox</a> extension that builds on the <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615">extension</a>.  This one finds the domain of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator"><span class="caps">URL</span></a> you&#8217;re bookmarking and adds it as a tag to your bookmark.  It&#8217;s basically just a copy of my <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/12/18/extracting-my-del-icio-us-permalinks-functionality-into-its-own-firefox-extension">del.icio.us permalinks extension</a></p>


	<p>To install this extension head over to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/delicious-domain-tags">delicious domain tags google group</a> and visit the installation page (I don&#8217;t seem to be able to link directly to it for some reason).</p>


	<p>I came across an interesting problem when trying to get both this and the del.icio.us permalinks extension working together.  Both of the extensions modify the onload attribute of the add bookmark dialog.  When I only had the del.icio.us permalinks extension I was hardcoding the onload attribute to call my function (deliciousPermalinks.addPermalinkTag()) and the original function (yAddBookMark.init()).  This approach fell down as soon as I had two extensions trying to modify the onload attribute: I didn&#8217;t know which extension would be loaded first and therefore one was always overwriting the other.  I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a nice way to do this but I hacked together a noddy initialisation script that finds the existing value of the onload attribute and adds to it with the relevant function.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">var yAddBookmarkDialog = document.getElementById('dlg_AddYBookMark');
var yAddBookmarkOnload = yAddBookmarkDialog.getAttribute('onload');
var onload = 'deliciousPermalinks.addPermalinkTag()';
yAddBookmarkDialog.setAttribute('onload', [yAddBookmarkOnload, onload].join(';'))</code></pre></div>

	<p>I reference this script in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL">xul</a> file which causes it to be evaluated at (I guess) browser start time and the onload event to be modified correctly.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve updated the del.icio.us permalinks extension too but I think you&#8217;ll need to remove and re-add it again from the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/delicious-permalinks/files">installation page</a>.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve been a bit quiet on the blogging front (to be fair, I&#8217;ve always been a bit slack) but I think it&#8217;s for good reason: I&#8217;ve re-discovered a love for programming, and in particular, creating things that I (and hopefully others) find useful.</p>


	<p>So, as a bit of an update, and a bit of a reminder for me, I thought I&#8217;d list all the things I&#8217;m either working on or thinking about.  Feel free to ask questions in the comments or by emailing me (chris at this domain).</p>


	<h2>Projects</h2>


	<h3>Atom (like <span class="caps">RSS</span>) feed for thisiskent news content</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m interested in reading news articles from the local area but the <a href="http://www.thisiskent.co.uk">thisiskent website</a> doesn&#8217;t provide a feed for me to subscribe to.  I&#8217;ve created a little project that scrapes the news content from that site and produces a feed.  The feed is currently at <a href="http://seagul.co.uk/thisiskent-thanet.atom">http://seagul.co.uk/thisiskent-thanet.atom</a> but will possibly move in the future.</p>


	<h3>The Local Paper</h3>


	<p>I wanted to give each article, in our local papers, a permalink so that people had a way to reference an article they were talking about.  I&#8217;ve started building the site over at <a href="http://the-local-paper.co.uk">http://the-local-paper.co.uk</a>.  There&#8217;s a long way to go but I really wanted to start getting some content up so that I had more incentive to continue.</p>

	<h3>Sending trackbacks to pages that I bookmark in <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a></h3>


	<p>I asked for this a while back in the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-delicious/message/1447">del.icio.us group</a>.  It occurred to me that I could add the functionality myself to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615">del.icio.us firefox extension</a>, so I did.  It&#8217;s more of a proof of concept at the moment but you can follow <a href="/articles/2008/02/04/sending-trackbacks-to-the-sites-that-you-bookmark-in-del-icio-us">these instructions</a> if you wish to try it out.</p>

	<h3>Adding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink">permalinks</a> to del.icio.us bookmarks</h3>


	<p>This was the precursor to the trackbacks project above.  I&#8217;ve created a firefox extension that, building on the del.icio.us extension, adds a &#8216;permalink tag&#8217; to each bookmark you create.  You can read more <a href="/articles/2007/12/18/extracting-my-del-icio-us-permalinks-functionality-into-its-own-firefox-extension">here</a> or visit the <a href="http://delicious-permalinks.googlegroups.com/web/installation.html">installation page</a> to install the extension.</p>

	<h3>Some blogging software</h3>


	<p>I decided that I really didn&#8217;t need the overhead of <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/">typo</a> to produce what is essentially a static site.  The result is some software that produces the website that you&#8217;re reading now.  I actually need to get some work done on this because I&#8217;m currently in a position where it&#8217;s harder for me to add content now than it used to be with typo.  D&#8217;oh.</p>

	<h3>An <span class="caps">SMS</span> service to lookup train information</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve built a service on top of <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a> that allows you to request departure information.  This is actually live now (read the <a href="/articles/2007/07/24/train-times-by-sms-or-improving-national-rail-enquiries">instructions</a>) but could be a lot more useful.  I&#8217;ve found that my main use case is to find the next few trains from a specific station within the next half hour or so &#8211; I&#8217;m hoping to make the interface better suit this need.</p>

	<h3>Software to interface with banking websites and download/convert the data to <a href="http://www.ofx.net/"><span class="caps">OFX</span></a> (for upload to <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">wesabe</a>)</h3>


	<p>A while back, I got quite addicted to using wesabe in an attempt to manage my finances (as it happens I&#8217;ve been very slack on this front too &#8211; managing money is just boring).  I wrote some scripts to download data from my banks&#8217; websites and additionally to convert that data to <span class="caps">OFX</span>.</p>

	<h3>A ruby implementation of <a href="http://www.pwdhash.com">pwdhash</a></h3>


	<p>I wanted a command line version of the pwdhash tool.  I knocked up a ruby implementation but haven&#8217;t really got round to making it command line friendly.</p>

	<h2>Ideas</h2>


	<h3>A del.icio.us extension that mines del.icio.us (and magnolia etc) to find similar sites to those that I&#8217;m looking at</h3>


	<p>I did a fair bit of investigation into this, although I&#8217;m not sure any of it is of any real use.  I was working on the theory that if the page I&#8217;m looking at is tagged with, for example, &#8216;train&#8217;, &#8216;uk&#8217; and &#8216;travel&#8217; then other pages tagged in the same way would probably also be of interest.  Check the <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious_similar_sites">delicious_similar_sites</a> and <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious-sidebar">delicious-sidebar</a> projects to check my progress.</p>

	<h3>A hosted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">trackback</a> / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback">pingback</a> service</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;m thinking of something like <a href="http://www.disqus.com">disqus</a> (hosted comments service) but for trackbacks/pingbacks.  I did find a site called <a href="http://www.trackbackr.com">trackbackr</a> that would appear to offer something similar but I haven&#8217;t looked into it in any detail.</p>


	<h3>A hosted redirection service</h3>


	<p>I want an easy way to create short/friendly URLs for a domain that I own.  I&#8217;ve started exploring the possibility of a RESTful service to do just this.  There&#8217;s some initial code over on <a href="http://chrisroos.co.uk/code/mongrel-redirection">google code</a></p>

	<h3>A mobile friendly version of the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk">National Rail Enquiries</a> website</h3>


	<p>I need to check whether this is already covered by the <a href="http://www.traintimes.org.uk">accessible national rails</a> website.</p>


	<h3>An <span class="caps">SMS</span> alert with train information</h3>


	<p>For three mornings a week, I get a regular train.  I&#8217;d like to receive a text message, half an hour (or so) before I leave house, that tells me whether the train is running on time.</p>


	<h3>A receipt tagging application (del.icio.us for receipts)</h3>


	<p>Until recently I had a lot of receipts stored on my email server.  This didn&#8217;t feel like the right place for them so I&#8217;ve placed them all on my laptop, in a folder that gets backed up to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> with the help of <a href="http://jungledisk.com">jungledisk</a>.  I&#8217;d like to be able to tag these receipts to make retrieval easier.  Ooh, I just had a thought &#8211; I wonder if I could just bookmark their <span class="caps">S3 URL</span> in del.icio.us&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Some software to track my unsubscriptions</h3>


	<p>Marketing emails annoy me.  I almost certainly don&#8217;t want them.  More importantly, when I state that I don&#8217;t want them, I want to have my wishes respected.  I knew that I was getting emails from companies that I&#8217;d unsubscribed from and wanted to track the offenders.  I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://www.stikipad.com">stikipad</a> wiki to do this but it&#8217;s not exactly ideal.  I&#8217;d like a service that will collect these emails (I&#8217;m thinking that I&#8217;ll forward them straight there) and report on those naughty companies that keep spamming me.</p>

	<h3>A firefox extension/<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">greasemonkey</a> script to determine the canonical <span class="caps">URL</span> of a resource</h3>


	<p>At one stage I was trying to use del.icio.us to manage the stuff I had for sale on <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk">ebay</a>.  Unfortunately, ebay is a bit naughty with their URLs (the same item for sale is available at different URLs) which meant I could end up bookmarking one <span class="caps">URL</span> and then not find my bookmark notes again &#8211; even though I knew I was looking at the same item.  I figure that we could maintain a list of rules that allow you to turn any <span class="caps">URL</span> into its canonical version.  This wouldn&#8217;t be ebay specific.</p>

	<h3>A website with lots of info about swimming pools</h3>


	<p>I&#8217;ve found it quite hard to find swimming pools close to work in the past.  I&#8217;d like a site that has a map of all swimming pools in the local area along with info (opening times, costs) and reviews of those pools (when&#8217;s a good time to go).</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve only recently discovered that thisiskent.co.uk (the website of three of our local newspapers) place their <a href="http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=250478&#38;command=newPage">news content</a> online.  Unfortunately they&#8217;ve neglected to provide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS"><span class="caps">RSS</span></a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom</a> feeds which means that I don&#8217;t get to see it (visiting websites is soooo old school).  As I&#8217;m kinda interested in reading this news, I&#8217;ve put something together that creates a feed from their news articles.  The feed currently lives at http://seagul.co.uk/thisiskent-thanet.atom although this will probably move in the future.  Feel free to subscribe to the feed and please leave comments if it&#8217;s not working for you.  I&#8217;m currently only interested in the Thanet news section but I&#8217;d be happy to produce a feed for other areas if people are interested.</p>

                <p>I know they have their problems (I had 26 good and 38428 spam when they were enabled on my site) but I&#8217;ve always liked the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">trackbacks</a> (and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback">pingback</a> alternative).</p>


	<p>A few months back I started thinking about <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-delicious/message/1447">sending trackbacks when bookmarking pages in del.icio.us</a>.  Having been told that, although it was something that had been considered, it wasn&#8217;t likely to be added anytime soon I decided to take a look at adding the functionality myself.</p>


	<p>The <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/docs/trackback_spec">trackback specification</a> states that I must send the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink">permalink</a> of my &#8216;post&#8217; to the resource that I&#8217;m tracking back to.  By design, individual posts (or bookmarks) in <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> aren&#8217;t addressable by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier"><span class="caps">URI</span></a>.  So, the first step was to <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/09/04/permalinks-for-del-icio-us-bookmarks-posts">add permalinks to my del.icio.us bookmarks</a>.  This was a kludgy, manual fix that added permalinks to all my old bookmarks: it didn&#8217;t work for any new bookmarks.</p>


	<p>From here, I spent some time <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/09/05/patching-the-del-icio-us-firefox-extension-to-add-permalinks">hacking around with the del.icio.us firefox extension</a> to get it to automatically generate these permalink tags.</p>


	<p>The final stage was to <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/12/18/extracting-my-del-icio-us-permalinks-functionality-into-its-own-firefox-extension">extract the hacked-in functionality into its own extension</a> (an extension of an extension &#8211; cool huh).</p>


	<p>Somehow, it took until about a month ago for me to realise that I now had everything in place to actually add trackback support to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615">del.icio.us firefox extension</a>.  I started looking at it last week and I&#8217;ve just finish up the proof of concept this morning.  At present, it scans the page you&#8217;re bookmarking looking for an anchor tag with rel=trackback (because this is easier than trying to parse the <span class="caps">RDF</span>).  If it finds one then it uses the url-tag from the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/delicious-permalinks">del.icio.us permalinks</a> extension to construct the permalink for your (to-be-created) bookmark and promptly goes off to send a trackback.</p>


	<p>The code is over in my <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/delicious-trackbacks/">google code repository</a>.  It&#8217;s very rough around the edges so I&#8217;m holding off providing a compiled version just yet.  If you really want to play along then you can follow these steps:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Install the del.icio.us firefox extension (to be fair, I&#8217;m going to assume that you&#8217;re probably at this stage already)</li>
		<li>Install the del.icio.us permalinks extension</li>
		<li>Checkout out the del.icio.us trackbacks source</li>
		<li>Find your Firefox extensions directory</li>
		<li>Create a textfile called delicious-trackbacks@googlegroups.com</li>
		<li>Add the path to the checked out project del.icio.us trackbacks project to this textfile</li>
		<li>Restart firefox</li>
		<li>Hope it all works and doesn&#8217;t destroy your computer :-)</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Oh, and I&#8217;ve created a real simple <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/scratch/trackback-server/">trackback server</a> (well, a <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">mongrel</a> handler) and a dummy page that includes a link to this server so that you can see the trackbacks being sent.</p>
