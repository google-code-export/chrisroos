                <p>I wasted a few hours of my life, over the weekend, playing with <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a>.  I had, what I thought to be, a fairly simple problem to solve: I wanted requests for index.html within any subdirectory of my site to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection">redirected</a> to the root of that subdirectory.  So, a request for example.com/subdir/index.html would be (301) redirected to example.com/subdir/.</p>


	<p>I thought I could do this without using <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteCond">RewriteCond</a>.  I tried something like this.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.html$ $1 [R=301]</code></pre></div>

	<p>I would expect this to match requests for URLs that end with index.html and redirect them to the <span class="caps">URL</span> minus index.html.  Although this correctly redirected /subdir/index.html to /subdir/ it would also attempt to redirect /subdir/ to /subdir/ resulting in an infinite loop.  It took me a very long time to work out, what I believe, is going on.  If I understand correctly, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">apache</a> will send every request (i.e. not just the request you issue from the browser) through mod_rewrite.  When we request /subdir/, apache will try, and fail, to match that <span class="caps">URL</span> with our regex (/subdir/ doesn&#8217;t end with index.html).  Internally, apache then &#8216;requests&#8217; index.html (since index.html is the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex">DirectoryIndex</a>).  This request matches our regex which results in apache sending the 301 redirect and us ending up with an infinite loop.  If I mis-understand what&#8217;s going on please feel free to correct me.</p>


	<p>Based on this assumption, I figured I&#8217;d need to use RewriteCond to somehow ignore the internal request for index.html.  I initially added a condition that checked for the <span class="caps">REQUEST</span>_URI ending in index.html (<code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} index\.html$</code>).  This suffered the same problem as my initial attempt.  A little more reading led me to the IS_SUBREQ special variable.  I thought this might allow me to ignore the &#8216;internal request&#8217; for index.html (<code>RewriteCond %{IS_SUBREQ} false</code>) but I couldn&#8217;t get it to have any effect.</p>


	<p>In searching for answers to this problem I kept seeing <span class="caps">THE</span>_REQUEST special variable used in the solution, although never an explanation as to why it&#8217;s used (specifically in preference to <span class="caps">REQUEST</span>_URI).  I ended up using <span class="caps">THE</span>_REQUEST in my solution (not technically my solution as I stole it from a site that I failed to bookmark) and it seems to work OK.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,9}\ /.*index\.html\ HTTP/
RewriteRule ^(.*)index\.html$ $1 [R=301,L]</code></pre></div>

	<p>I&#8217;m guessing that this is because <span class="caps">THE</span>_REQUEST contains the full details (the stuff that appears in the log file) of the request from the client (browser) and will therefore be empty for any &#8216;internal requests&#8217;.  Anyone know if my assumptions are correct?</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve often felt the need to search through our <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> repository to find, for example, when a method was removed/renamed.  As far as I&#8217;m aware there&#8217;s no easy way to do this using the standard subversion, or <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a>, tools.  A few days ago the need arose once more: I wanted to know when a particular class had stopped being used within our codebase.  It struck me that if I had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> file for each changeset that I&#8217;d be able to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> for the change I was looking for.  I hacked together a script to produce a diff of each changeset (actually, as I knew when the class was added, I only produced a diff for a subset of the changesets) and was able to find the information I needed.  The script is pasted below and on <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/svn_changesets/">google code</a>.  It assumes that you are running it from within an svn working direction.  It took a while to produce the diff files (I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have any stats) but the result was a really fast way of finding, otherwise hard to find, information.  I guess it&#8217;d be quite easy to automate the diff creation process so that you had an always up-to-date bunch of diff fies&#8230;</p>


	<p>Is this useful, or have I missed something obvious in Subversion or Trac that does exactly this?</p>
