                </p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve created a little script that allows me to convert documents in the <a href="http://code.google.com">google code</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax">wiki format</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><span class="caps">HTML</span></a>.</p>


	<p>The script lives in <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com">my google code repository</a>.  Check it out from subversion:</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">svn co http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-wiki-syntax</code></pre></div>

	<p>The wiki_convertor script takes two arguments.  The first is the wiki file, or directory containing multiple wiki files, and the second is the output directory.  So, to use it to create an html copy of the <a href="http://code.google.com/doctype/">google-doctype</a> wiki content, in my home Sites directory, I&#8217;d use the following command:</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">wiki_convertor.rb ~/Code/third-party/google-doctype/wiki/ ~/Sites/google-doctype/</code></pre></div>

	<p>This is the first step towards being able to, hopefully, create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">pdf</a> copy of the google-doctype content.  Actually, if anyone has any thoughts on this I&#8217;d love to hear them: should I output a different format (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook">docbook</a>, for example) or is it easy enough to convert from (x)html to pdf?</p>


	<p>The code is covered by quite a few tests but, if peeps find problems converting their own wiki content (for example) then I&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>


	<p><strong>Note</strong> There&#8217;s a chance that this becomes less important <a href="http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-documentation-reader)s(google-documentation-reader)t(OfflineSupport">if/when</a> Google use <a href="http://gears.google.com/">gears</a> in their <a href="http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-documentation-reader)s(google-documentation-reader)t(google-documentation-reader">google docreader</a> app to allow offline access.</p>


	<p><strong>Note</strong> If you don&#8217;t want to go through this process then you can use a standalone version of <a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/">moinmoin</a> to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-doctype/browse_thread/thread/5fe1d26a0afdc4c7">view your wiki content offline</a>.</p>

                </p>

                <p>There&#8217;s a bunch of stuff that I want to do to this blog to simplify things even further. I&#8217;m writing them up to force me to think about them and to see if anyone has any thoughts about my proposals. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s lots more I could do but this should keep me busy for quite a while.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Remove the archive pages.  These are the pages that exist so that you can see every post in a given year, month or day.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever wanted to read these archives on anyone elses site and I can&#8217;t think that anyone would want to do so here.  They are not linked from anywhere on this site (I removed the links when I switched to a <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2008/01/23/migration-from-typo-to-a-static-site-is-complete">static site</a>) but I know they are still in the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk">google</a> index.  I find it annoying if I click on a link to such an archive page as I then have to do a second search, within the page, to find what I&#8217;m looking for.  I guess this might be one of the reasons why google&#8217;s guidelines state that you should <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769">use robots.txt to prevent crawling of SERPs</a> (more info from <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/search-results-in-search-results/">Matt Cutts</a>).  It&#8217;s for this reason that I removed all paging on the site and redirect anyone that follows a link to a paged page (e.g. articles/page/5) to my <a href="/contents">contents</a> page, explaining why they might not be expecting to see that page.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Change the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator"><span class="caps">URL</span></a> structure to reflect the removal of the archive pages.  My URLs currently look something like /articles/2007/01/01/article-title.  I want to change them to /articles/2007-01-01-title.  This will still allow people, if they really, really wanted, to replicate the functionality of my archive pages by using the google site search functionality (site:blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007-05 for all articles in May 2007, for example).  Retaining the date in the <span class="caps">URL</span> has two (that I can think of) benefits: I find it really useful to get an idea of the age (and possibly relevancy) of a post, and it provides a neat way to generate permalinks.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Remove the tag pages.  For the same reason that I&#8217;ve removed the paged pages and want to remove the archive pages.  I haven&#8217;t been tagging any articles since the switch to a static site and only maintain these pages for the legacy tags.  If I really suffer from the lack of tags then I guess I&#8217;ll just use a tagging service (such as <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>) to bookmark my posts with relevant tags.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Remove articles from the url, so that /articles/2007-01-01-blurgh becomes /2007-01-01-blurgh.  It doesn&#8217;t add anything and I&#8217;m not worried about namespace clashes (one thing it could potentially solve).</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Move all the content from blog.seagul.co.uk to chrisroos.co.uk/blog.  I want to start using this domain as a starting point for my online identity.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Create chrisroos.co.uk/projects in an attempt to record details of the things that I might class as projects.  This might also solve some of the shortfalls of not having tags (if I did have tags then I might be able to implement this projects idea by using them).</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Add the ability to search the site from the site itself (using <a href="http://www.google.com/sitesearch/">google site search</a> or similar). I sometimes find the need to search my own site and having to do site:blog.seagul.co.uk keywords can become frustrating.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Revisit previous articles and add meta descriptions to their pages.  This is the text that google displays in their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page">SERPs</a> and is generally useful as an overview of the content.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Add the permalink of each post in the form of a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-bookmark">link rel=bookmark</a>.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Add link tags (prev, next, home?) to describe the <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_9_providing_additional_navigation_aids.html">relationship between posts</a>.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Remove the embedded syntax highlighting from some of the posts, preferring, instead, a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/">javascript solution</a>.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Attempt to clear up any broken links in the content.</li>
	</ul>


	<p><strong>Note</strong> A guiding principle behind the removal of composite pages (tags, archives and paged pages) is that a post should only appear at one <span class="caps">URL</span> on this site.</p>


	<p><strong>Note</strong> I believe there may be benefits of the archive and tag pages in that they allow search engines to effectively spider all your content. I&#8217;m fairly happy that my contents page and sitemap mean that I&#8217;m covered in this respect.</p>


	<h3>Steps required to move towards the architecture (URL) changes</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>Add <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noindex">noindex</a> to all the archive pages, and optionally request their removal, so that they disappear from the search engine indexes.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Add noindex to all the tag pages, and optionally request their removal, so that they disappear from the search engine indexes.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Possibly redirect requests for archive pages to a google search that provides the same functionality.  Alternatively redirect them to my contents page.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Redirect requests for tag pages to my contents page.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Redirect all requests for URLs that start with /articles to the <span class="caps">URL</span> without /articles.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Redirect all requests for URLs on the blog.seagul.co.uk domain to chrisroos.co.uk/blog.</li>
	</ul>

                <p><strong>I noticed, having already written everything below, that there&#8217;s actually quite a lot of information about the high speed proposals on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_(train_operating_company)#Future_expansion">South Eastern</a> <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a> page.</strong></p>


	<p>There&#8217;s been lots of speculation about the new high speed trains that are going to decrease journey times from, parts of, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent">Kent</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a>.  The south eastern site is very sparse on the details of these new services so I thought I&#8217;d email them to ask for more details: I&#8217;m specifically interested in journey times from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> to London.  I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised, but their answer contains essentially no information.</p>


	<p>I mentioned to a signal man friend at the weekend and he was of the impression that they&#8217;d be running fast services direct from Ramsgate to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pancras_railway_station">St Pancras</a> and from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury">Canterbury</a> to St Pancras.  I&#8217;ll guess we&#8217;ll just have to wait a year or so to find out what they&#8217;re actually going to do.</p>


	<p>My email (submitted through their <a href="http://southeasternrailway.co.uk/contact.php">contact form</a>)</p>


<div class="email">
Hi,

	<p>I wonder if you’d be able to let me know your plans for services between Ramsgate and London when the new high speed trains are introduced?  Although there’s been a great deal of speculation about a high speed service between Ramsgate and St Pancras, I’ve never seen anything concrete.  Indeed, from what I’ve read so far, I’m guessing that there won’t be a direct high speed link between Ramsgate and London (I’d love to hear otherwise though).  Rather, I suspect that it’ll be possible to get a traditional train from Ramsgate to Ashford and then to join a high speed train to St Pancras (so the journey time will be about 77 minutes on the train with a change at Ashford).  Is this the plan?</p>


	<p>I also wonder if you might shed some light on the proposed price increases to use the new high speed service?</p>


	<p>Cheers, and I look forward to a reply,</p>


Chris

	<p>Dear Mr Roos,</p>


	<p><span class="caps">HS1</span> services</p>


	<p>Thank you for your website comment that we received on 10 July 2008, regarding the high speed services that will commence in 2009.</p>


	<p>We will be introducing services on <span class="caps">HS1</span> (the new name for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link) from December 2009 and the timetable for our existing ‘classic’ routes will be re-drawn completely.</p>


	<p>Services using <span class="caps">HS1</span> will go to London&#8217;s St Pancras station and journey times from places like Ashford, Folkestone, Canterbury, Ramsgate and Dover will be significantly reduced. We understand that many people are keen to know exactly what the timetable and fares will be, but I hope you will understand that this is still at the planning stage and the details are yet to be finalised.</p>


	<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) has set out the overarching specification for the timetable that we will deliver. We are currently reviewing this specification and have started to test the journey times with the first of the new trains. Once we are able to share the detail of the timetable we will communicate it to customers via our website and the media. As with any other timetable change, we will be consulting with Passenger Focus and London TravelWatch, the two main passenger watchdogs before the timetable is introduced. So if a strong economic argument for a particular service can be demonstrated, and the railway industry can accommodate it, we would present a business case to the DtT to support its introduction.</p>


	<p>ln the meantime, our website does have some details about the proposed journey times and routes. This can be located on our homepage by clicking on &#8220;High Speed Services&#8221; on the left hand side and then &#8220;Frequency of trains&#8221;.</p>


	<p>Thank you for taking the time to contact us.</p>


	<p>Yours sincerely</p>

                <p>I regularly travel on the <a href="http://southeasternrailway.co.uk/">South Eastern</a> service from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_East_railway_station">Waterloo East</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a>.  The train splits at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford_International">Ashford</a> and I end up having to sit in the shitty commuter seats for the last 45 minutes (or so) of the journey.  I emailed South Eastern to ask if they couldn&#8217;t reconfigure the train so that, of the eight cars that go to Dover, four could have commuter seats and four could have real seats.  They could then send the other four cars, with real seats, to Ramsgate.  I don&#8217;t think I have the original email that I sent (feedback forms in general suffer from the problem that the sender doesn&#8217;t retain a copy of what&#8217;s been sent) but their reply is below (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2688362397/">original here</a>).</p>

	<p>Dear Mr Roos</p>


	<p>Formation of 17.59 Waterloo East to Ramsgate Service</p>


	<p>Thank you for your email of 2nd May</p>


	<p>I am sorry that you have found the seating on the rear four carriages of the above service to be uncomfortable. These are the higher density carriages that have 2+3 seating across the coach, rather than 2+2 seating, and are intended to deal with the heavy demand we face during the busy peak periods. We know that everyone would prefer all our trains to have 2+2 seating throughout. However, we have to utilise the higher density seating layout in order to provide enough seats for our London commuters.</p>


	<p>For a number of operational factors (for example, rolling stock maintenance), it is difficult to locate a set of four higher density carriages in the middle of a twelve-coach train, where the front and rear portions are formed of 2+2 seating. The usual procedure is to have four or eight carriages which are the same, and to have an additonai four carriages of either the higher density or 2+2 rolling stock. In addition to this, we have to look at the wider picture and consider what is needed for later services or on the following morning (as a rule, it is not possible to &#8220;mix-and-match&#8221; rolling stock to it each journey).</p>


	<p>For these reasons, it is unlikely that we will be able to make the change that to have requested. Thank you, however, for sharing your concerns with us. Passenger feedback, whether good or bad, is always appreciated so that we can continue to improve on the service we offer, and I hope you can be reassured that we take all issues very seriously.</p>


	<p>Yours sincerely</p>

                <p>I recently received a letter reply to an enquiry I made to <a href="http://southeasternrailway.co.uk/">South Eastern Trains</a>.  I wanted to make the text available (I don&#8217;t like reading text in images) but didn&#8217;t want to type it all out.  Having scanned it in, I looked around for some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"><span class="caps">OCR</span></a> software, for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/">Mac</a>, that would extract the text for me.  Through the (relatively large amount of) search result noise, I managed to find a reference to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">tesseract</a>.  Installing from <a href="http://www.macports.org/">Mac Ports</a> was easy but actually getting useful output was slightly tricker.  I was trying to extract the text from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2688362397/">this letter</a> but kept getting garbled output.  I tried a few things before stumbling across <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OCR">this page</a> that suggests making the image greyscale and ensuring that the extension is .tif (not .tiff).  I duly complied, using <a href="http://seashore.sourceforge.net/">Seashore</a> to convert the image to greyscale, and tried again.  This time the text was extracted perfectly (even the addresses, that appear in two columns, were extracted correctly).</p>
