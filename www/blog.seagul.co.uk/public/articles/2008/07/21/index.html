                <p><strong>I noticed, having already written everything below, that there&#8217;s actually quite a lot of information about the high speed proposals on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_(train_operating_company)#Future_expansion">South Eastern</a> <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a> page.</strong></p>


	<p>There&#8217;s been lots of speculation about the new high speed trains that are going to decrease journey times from, parts of, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent">Kent</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a>.  The south eastern site is very sparse on the details of these new services so I thought I&#8217;d email them to ask for more details: I&#8217;m specifically interested in journey times from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> to London.  I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised, but their answer contains essentially no information.</p>


	<p>I mentioned to a signal man friend at the weekend and he was of the impression that they&#8217;d be running fast services direct from Ramsgate to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pancras_railway_station">St Pancras</a> and from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury">Canterbury</a> to St Pancras.  I&#8217;ll guess we&#8217;ll just have to wait a year or so to find out what they&#8217;re actually going to do.</p>


	<p>My email (submitted through their <a href="http://southeasternrailway.co.uk/contact.php">contact form</a>)</p>

Hi,

	<p>I wonder if you’d be able to let me know your plans for services between Ramsgate and London when the new high speed trains are introduced?  Although there’s been a great deal of speculation about a high speed service between Ramsgate and St Pancras, I’ve never seen anything concrete.  Indeed, from what I’ve read so far, I’m guessing that there won’t be a direct high speed link between Ramsgate and London (I’d love to hear otherwise though).  Rather, I suspect that it’ll be possible to get a traditional train from Ramsgate to Ashford and then to join a high speed train to St Pancras (so the journey time will be about 77 minutes on the train with a change at Ashford).  Is this the plan?</p>


	<p>I also wonder if you might shed some light on the proposed price increases to use the new high speed service?</p>


	<p>Cheers, and I look forward to a reply,</p>


Chris

	<p>Dear Mr Roos,</p>


	<p><span class="caps">HS1</span> services</p>


	<p>Thank you for your website comment that we received on 10 July 2008, regarding the high speed services that will commence in 2009.</p>


	<p>We will be introducing services on <span class="caps">HS1</span> (the new name for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link) from December 2009 and the timetable for our existing ‘classic’ routes will be re-drawn completely.</p>


	<p>Services using <span class="caps">HS1</span> will go to London&#8217;s St Pancras station and journey times from places like Ashford, Folkestone, Canterbury, Ramsgate and Dover will be significantly reduced. We understand that many people are keen to know exactly what the timetable and fares will be, but I hope you will understand that this is still at the planning stage and the details are yet to be finalised.</p>


	<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) has set out the overarching specification for the timetable that we will deliver. We are currently reviewing this specification and have started to test the journey times with the first of the new trains. Once we are able to share the detail of the timetable we will communicate it to customers via our website and the media. As with any other timetable change, we will be consulting with Passenger Focus and London TravelWatch, the two main passenger watchdogs before the timetable is introduced. So if a strong economic argument for a particular service can be demonstrated, and the railway industry can accommodate it, we would present a business case to the DtT to support its introduction.</p>


	<p>ln the meantime, our website does have some details about the proposed journey times and routes. This can be located on our homepage by clicking on &#8220;High Speed Services&#8221; on the left hand side and then &#8220;Frequency of trains&#8221;.</p>


	<p>Thank you for taking the time to contact us.</p>


	<p>Yours sincerely</p>

                <p>I regularly travel on the <a href="http://southeasternrailway.co.uk/">South Eastern</a> service from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_East_railway_station">Waterloo East</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a>.  The train splits at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford_International">Ashford</a> and I end up having to sit in the shitty commuter seats for the last 45 minutes (or so) of the journey.  I emailed South Eastern to ask if they couldn&#8217;t reconfigure the train so that, of the eight cars that go to Dover, four could have commuter seats and four could have real seats.  They could then send the other four cars, with real seats, to Ramsgate.  I don&#8217;t think I have the original email that I sent (feedback forms in general suffer from the problem that the sender doesn&#8217;t retain a copy of what&#8217;s been sent) but their reply is below (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2688362397/">original here</a>).</p>

	<p>Dear Mr Roos</p>


	<p>Formation of 17.59 Waterloo East to Ramsgate Service</p>


	<p>Thank you for your email of 2nd May</p>


	<p>I am sorry that you have found the seating on the rear four carriages of the above service to be uncomfortable. These are the higher density carriages that have 2+3 seating across the coach, rather than 2+2 seating, and are intended to deal with the heavy demand we face during the busy peak periods. We know that everyone would prefer all our trains to have 2+2 seating throughout. However, we have to utilise the higher density seating layout in order to provide enough seats for our London commuters.</p>


	<p>For a number of operational factors (for example, rolling stock maintenance), it is difficult to locate a set of four higher density carriages in the middle of a twelve-coach train, where the front and rear portions are formed of 2+2 seating. The usual procedure is to have four or eight carriages which are the same, and to have an additonai four carriages of either the higher density or 2+2 rolling stock. In addition to this, we have to look at the wider picture and consider what is needed for later services or on the following morning (as a rule, it is not possible to &#8220;mix-and-match&#8221; rolling stock to it each journey).</p>


	<p>For these reasons, it is unlikely that we will be able to make the change that to have requested. Thank you, however, for sharing your concerns with us. Passenger feedback, whether good or bad, is always appreciated so that we can continue to improve on the service we offer, and I hope you can be reassured that we take all issues very seriously.</p>


	<p>Yours sincerely</p>

                <p>I recently received a letter reply to an enquiry I made to <a href="http://southeasternrailway.co.uk/">South Eastern Trains</a>.  I wanted to make the text available (I don&#8217;t like reading text in images) but didn&#8217;t want to type it all out.  Having scanned it in, I looked around for some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"><span class="caps">OCR</span></a> software, for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/">Mac</a>, that would extract the text for me.  Through the (relatively large amount of) search result noise, I managed to find a reference to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">tesseract</a>.  Installing from <a href="http://www.macports.org/">Mac Ports</a> was easy but actually getting useful output was slightly tricker.  I was trying to extract the text from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2688362397/">this letter</a> but kept getting garbled output.  I tried a few things before stumbling across <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OCR">this page</a> that suggests making the image greyscale and ensuring that the extension is .tif (not .tiff).  I duly complied, using <a href="http://seashore.sourceforge.net/">Seashore</a> to convert the image to greyscale, and tried again.  This time the text was extracted perfectly (even the addresses, that appear in two columns, were extracted correctly).</p>
