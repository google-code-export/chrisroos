                <p>I finally got round to updating my blog template this weekend.  I based the new design on the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/">yui grids css</a> in an attempt to provide the same look to users of different browsers.  In addition I&#8217;ve &#8216;borrowed&#8217; some ideas from both the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">w3c specification pages</a> (the blue colour) and the <a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/theme/copyblogger/">copyblogger wordpress theme</a> (mainly the header, seen on <a href="http://www.techbelly.com">Ben&#8217;s</a> blog).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve also created a really simple print stylesheet (it just removes the right nav) that should make it possible to print the content out if you so wish.</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s still work to do: the code snippets seem to break <span class="caps">IE6</span> (not sure about <span class="caps">IE7</span>) but in general I&#8217;m pretty happy with the way it&#8217;s looking.</p>

                <p>Exporting query results to a remote machine with MySql (an alternative to <span class="caps">SELECT INTO OUTFILE</span>)</p>


	<p><a href="http://mysql.com">MySql&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/select.html"><span class="caps">SELECT INTO OUTFILE</span></a> syntax provides a nice way to export the results of a query into a tab delimited (by default) text file.  Unfortunately, the file has to be created on the MySql host (by a user with file permissions), rendering it unsuitable for dumping the data to a remote machine.  If you wish to dump the query results to a different machine then the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/">mysql docs</a> suggest redirecting the output from the mysql command line client:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>The <span class="caps">SELECT</span> &#8230; <span class="caps">INTO OUTFILE</span> statement is intended primarily to let you very quickly dump a table to a text file on the server machine. If you want to create the resulting file on some client host other than the server host, you cannot use <span class="caps">SELECT</span> &#8230; <span class="caps">INTO OUTFILE</span>. In that case, you should instead use a command such as mysql -e &#8220;SELECT &#8230;&#8221; &gt;  file_name to generate the file on the client host.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>This works great but the default output you&#8217;ll get from redirecting <span class="caps">STDOUT</span> won&#8217;t be the same as using <span class="caps">SELECT INTO OUTFILE</span>.  The two main (only?) differences are, in the redirected output, the addition of the headers and that <span class="caps">NULL</span> values are output as <span class="caps">NULL</span> instead of the special \N (backslash-N) sequence.  We can fix both of these things by specifying an optional switch (skip-column-names) to the mysql client and employing some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a> magic.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">mysql -h&quot;my-host&quot; -u&quot;my-user&quot; -p&quot;my-password&quot; -e&quot;select * from my-database.my-table&quot; --skip-column-names |\
  sed -e 's/[[:&lt;:]]NULL[[:&gt;:]]/\\N/g' &gt;\
  my-export-directory/my-table.csv`</code></pre></div>

	<p>That sed magic is replacing instances of <span class="caps">NULL</span>, surrounded by some whitespace, with the special \N escape sequence.</p>


	<p>Oh, and it&#8217;s probably worth mentioning that this is only really important if you want to load this data back into mysql (using <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/load-data.html"><span class="caps">LOAD DATA INFILE</span></a> for example).  If you were to load the default output, from redirecting the mysql client, back into mysql then you&#8217;d end up with an unwanted header row and <span class="caps">NULL</span> strings (or 0 for numeric columns) where you expected actual <span class="caps">NULL</span> values.</p>


	<p>It took us a while to figure this out so I thought it might be of some use to others.</p>
