                <p>A couple of days ago, I received a comment to one of my articles.  &#8220;Hmm, that looks familiar I thought&#8221;, and not without good reason.  You see, the comment had been copied verbatim from another comment on the same article.  The only change was the author&#8217;s name and the url of their &#8216;homepage&#8217;.  After a little deliberation I deleted the comment.  I found it interesting for two reasons.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>The &#8216;homepage&#8217; link wasn&#8217;t obviously spam (it was some kind of kitchen site I believe), although a quick search did reveal it on some blacklists.</li>
		<li>I am unable to teach <a href="http://akismet.com/">akismet</a> (my current form of spam protection) to recognise these types of messages as spam, after all, the content itself is perfectly valid.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Anyway, I got on with my life until, whoah, it happened again this morning.  Same article but a different comment had been copied.  The mystery continues&#8230; (at least, until I forget about it again).</p>


	<p>Anyone else experienced this?</p>
