                <p>What a crappy title.  Ho hum.</p>


	<p>This bit explains the itch I had.  Skip over it if you like.</p>


	<p>I recently finished re-structuring some of the code at <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">work</a>, in which I namespaced all of the admin type controllers.  At the same time, I attempted to split some of the larger, confused (about their responsibilities) controllers into smaller chunks.  This all seems to have worked quite well, but we&#8217;ve ended up with some naff (I haven&#8217;t used that word in ages) action names.</p>


	<p>I like, where possible, to follow the scaffold naming convention (list, show, new, create, edit, update and destroy); and so went ahead and started changing things.  I was writing my tests like mum always said I should<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> when I realised that there was a bit missing (uh oh).  You see, I was ensuring that my controllers responded to certain actions; and I was also ensuring that my views had links to certain controllers and actions.  The missing link was a check as to whether the links in my views went to valid controller actions.  I could, for example, have been testing for a link to /foo/edit in my view but for an edit_foo action in my foo_controller test.  Both tests would pass, but the application would still be broken.  Not cool.  We do actually have <a href="http://openqa.org/selenium">something</a> in place to perform these tests but I&#8217;m still a bit scared of selenium and don&#8217;t use it as much as I should.</p>


	<p>Anyway, i started thinking about bending the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#M000378">link_to</a> helper to my will.  I figured that the little fella was a good candidate to not only give me a perfectly formed chunk of html goodness; but to also tell me whether the said chunk of html goodness was actually going to work (i.e. whether my app responded to the generated url).  Cool idea huh.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m getting tired and a little bored now so I&#8217;ll wrap this post up.  I&#8217;ve created a <a href="http://dev.seagul.co.uk/repository/browse/plugins/action_view_helper_url_helper">plugin</a> (svn co svn://dev.seagul.co.uk/plugins/action_view_helper_url_helper) that replaces the link_to method to add a class attribute (invalid_href_target or valid_href_target) to the generated anchor tag.  You could then use the assert_no_broken_links assertion to ensure there are no anchors with a class of invalid_href_target in your views; and/or you could style it (see resource/style.css as an example) so that you can see any broken links at a glance whilst in development (as shown in the image below).</p>


	<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/192/460075342_987c127e66_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>The code is pretty poor/naive, works with rails 1.0.0 (hence my trying to <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/08/14/create-rails-projects-using-a-specific-rails-gem-version">set-up a rails 1.0.0 app</a> earlier), doesn&#8217;t work with rails 1.1.6 (not sure about versions in between) and may or may not work for you.  I kinda think it&#8217;s a good idea but there&#8217;s every chance that a) it&#8217;s not or b) there&#8217;s already a simple solution to this problem.</p>


	<p>Let me know how you get on if you decide to risk the health of your project by trying this plugin.</p>

                <p>I <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/06/21/more-helpful-messages-for-active-record-validation-errors-in-rails-testing">posted</a> a while back about displaying the reasons for an active record model failing validation.</p>


	<p>I knew the code was hacky and nasty but didn&#8217;t realise quite how bad until I noticed how <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/tags/rel_1-1-0/activerecord/lib/active_record/validations.rb">simply</a>  (1 line) the same thing was implemented in <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2006/3/28/rails-1-1-rjs-active-record-respond_to-integration-tests-and-500-other-things">Rails 1.1</a> (and above).</p>


	<p>Although it&#8217;s only useful for people still on Rails 1.0, I made a quick plugin that backports this change.  I don&#8217;t really want to put it in my subversion repository, so have just pasted the necessary code below.</p>
