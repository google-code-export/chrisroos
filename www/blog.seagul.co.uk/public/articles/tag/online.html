                <p>It bugs me when I&#8217;m unable to cancel accounts I have for various online services.  I guess that I&#8217;ve possibly become annoyed by it because lots of the <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">more</a> <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">recent</a> (<a href="http://www.blinksale.com">cool</a>) <a href="http://www.strongspace.com">offerings</a> make it very easy to cancel.</p>


	<p>I was initially aiming this rant at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">yahoo</a> as I&#8217;ve had a user there for about seven years (hmm, that seems too long but I&#8217;m pretty certain it&#8217;s correct) and didn&#8217;t think I could cancel it.  It would actually appear that I can cancel it but they still make it relatively difficult to do (go to help, click on article, follow link and then cancel).</p>


	<p>Actually, I just changed the title of the post from <strong>I should be able to close online accounts</strong> to it&#8217;s present form due to the yahoo finding (although I&#8217;m pretty certain there are lots of other services that don&#8217;t allow for cancelling).</p>

                <p>Well, having used <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">bloglines</a> <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/10/02/online-news-reader">since</a> the beginning of October, I&#8217;ve just replaced it with <a href="http://www.rojo.com">rojo</a>.  There were a couple of anoyances with bloglines &#8211; the main one being that if you click on a folder, all stories are marked as read.  I realise that you can go through and keep them unread but if you click on a folder that contains <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a> and <a href="http://www.slashdot.com">slashdot</a>, that&#8217;s a lot of clicking when you might not have time right now.</p>


	<p>The main reason for switching to rojo is that it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_surprise">works as I would expect it to work</a>, particularly regarding the way in which stories are marked as read.  It also seems to offer lots of cool tagging/social features that I&#8217;m yet to explore.</p>
