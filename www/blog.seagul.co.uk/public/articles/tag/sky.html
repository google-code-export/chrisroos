                <p>I have three minor outstanding issues with a recent sky installation.  Not wanting to phone them (as previous experience suggests that it&#8217;s going to waste a lot of my life) I thought I&#8217;d drop them an email.</p>

	<p>Uh oh.  Looks like they don&#8217;t want my email.</p>

	<p>So now, not only have I wasted time waiting for their website to time out while signing up, but I&#8217;ve also wasted time filling in a useless feedback form, taking a screenshot and even blogging about it.  Oh, and I&#8217;m still going to have to speak to someone.  Brilliant.</p>
