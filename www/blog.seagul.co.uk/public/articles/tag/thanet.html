                <p>A <a href="http://birchington.blogspot.com/">local blogger</a> forwards a <a href="http://birchington.blogspot.com/2007/06/unusual-request.html">request</a> he&#8217;s received from a visiting pilot for photos to be taken of him practising at our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_International_Airport">local airstrip</a>.  I duly <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/sets/72157600450060497/">obliged</a> (not hard as I live under the flight path) as has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/doverpast/sets/72157600449864913/">one other</a> so far.  The Internet is great isn&#8217;t it.</p>

                <p><a href="http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk">Printerior Design</a> are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanet">local</a> (to me, probably not to you) firm that produce cool pictures.  They are beautiful <a href="http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk/galleries.html">photos</a> printed directly onto heavy duty metal &#8211; &#8216;man-art&#8217; if you will.  I bought <a href="http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk/landscapes/pages/Dawn%201500%20thumbnail%20with%20drop%20shadow_jpg.htm">this one</a> as a Christmas present.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk/landscapes/pages/Dawn%201500%20thumbnail%20with%20drop%20shadow_jpg.htm"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1239/534275282_2d4ba6dde1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>The reason for this post is because a friend recently asked me where I got the picture.  Not remembering the name of the company, I started googling.  I knew that they had pictures in Harpers Wine Bar (I thought they had a website but I can&#8217;t find it) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadstairs">Broadstairs</a>, and in the <a href="http://www.albionbroadstairs.co.uk/">Albion Hotel</a>, also in Broadstairs.  I also knew that their workshop was on Pysons Road Industrial estate.  Sadly, even with this info, they just weren&#8217;t appearing in google.  So, I&#8217;m hoping that this might help them out a little bit.</p>


	<p>I can&#8217;t help but think that they&#8217;d benefit massively from a blog about their work &#8211; I&#8217;m of the belief that what they do is pretty different.</p>


	<p><strong>Update</strong> I&#8217;ve uploaded a copy of the picture I have to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> and embedded it in this post &#8211; hoping the printerior guys don&#8217;t mind too much&#8230;</p>

                </p>

                <p>I just sent this email to the editors of four local papers.</p>


<blockquote>
Hi,

	<p>I&#8217;m emailing you as representatives of (what I believe to be) the four main newspapers in Thanet.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>KM Extra</li>
		<li>Thanet Adscene</li>
		<li>Isle of Thanet Gazette</li>
		<li>Thanet Times</li>
	</ul>


	<p>On the off chance you&#8217;re already bored or have filed me to spam (please don&#8217;t), a quick summary is that I&#8217;m offering to do some work, for free, that might help foster discussion around your newspaper content.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;d love it if all of your newspaper content was on-line.  I realise that both kentonline.co.uk and ickent.co.uk already exist and carry <strong>some</strong> of the content from your papers.  I also realise that it may not be commercially wise to publish all newspaper content on-line.</p>


	<p>So, I&#8217;ve come up with a very cunning (it&#8217;s not that cunning) plan.  I&#8217;m thinking of creating a blog-type site, where each post will represent a newspaper story.  I propose that the title of the blog post will be the title of the article in the paper, and that the body of the blog post will be left blank.  My intention is that people that buy/receive any of the above papers can use the permalink of the blog post as a central discussion point.  They can either comment right there on the blog or they can ping/trackback to the post from their own blogs.  The best thing that could happen is that other people stumble across these conversations and want to get involved, at which point they have to go buy a copy of the paper to get the original content.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m planning on doing this stuff anyway, but I wanted to give you guys a heads up.  I figure that this mail will either a) land in spamland, b) be received with a negative response, or c) be received with a positive response.  Oh, or d) received and ignored.  Pretty much covered all bases there haven&#8217;t I?  Anyhoo, I&#8217;d love to hear any thoughts you have, especially if they are strongly for or against the idea.</p>


	<p>This letter will be posted to my blog<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> shortly.  On the off chance you&#8217;ve read this far and feel like replying, I&#8217;d like to post them to my blog too, but that&#8217;s completely up to you.</p>


	<p>To summarize.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;d like to converse with other people that have read the same article that I have.</li>
		<li>The only content from your newspapers that will appear on-line is the heading of each article.</li>
		<li>I&#8217;m offering to do all the work.</li>
		<li>I&#8217;ll host the site and transcribe each article from each of the four weekly papers.</li>
		<li>The site won&#8217;t have advertising.</li>
		<li>Anyone can comment on the site.</li>
		<li>Anyone can trackback/pingback to the site.</li>
		<li>I can&#8217;t promise that I&#8217;ll keep up the work forever.</li>
		<li>All the content of the site will be available to anyone that wants it &#8211; probably under a creative commons license or something similar.</li>
		<li>I have no intention of making money from this.  In fact, I&#8217;m willing to pay money to make it happen.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Cheers,</p>


	<p>Chris</p>
