                <p>I just read <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/2007/11/16/can-vrm-fix-drm/">this</a> article over on the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/">Project <span class="caps">VRM</span></a> blog.  There was a fragment of a sentence that really resonated with me &#8211; highlighted in the quote below.</p>


<blockquote>
For copyrighted works, <span class="caps">VRM</span> could involve agreements made on an individual basis — ones that could involve actual relationships between copyright holders and their customers. For example, if I buy an open (non-DRM’d) copy of an album by Mike Marshall (my favorite mandolin player), it might involve letting him know who I am, the fact that I like his work, a commitment not to duplicate it beyond fair uses, and the option to do any number of things, <strong>including re-distributing it for pay that would get us both a slice of the take</strong>. The options are wide open. What matters is that there would means for a real reslationship based on mutual interest, trust and control.
</blockquote>

	<p>If I like something enough to want to recommend it to people why shouldn&#8217;t I take a small amount of money from any resulting transaction?  If I was to become an <a href="http://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/join/">Amazon affiliate</a> I could already get paid for recommending this album: except that I&#8217;d actually be getting paid for recommending this album <strong>at</strong> Amazon.  That just makes me feel a little less comfortable than if I was able to get paid for recommending the artist alone.</p>


	<p>Having spent about 30 minutes writing and re-writing to come up with that <strong>one</strong> paragraph above I&#8217;ve realised that I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on why I find the idea so powerful.</p>


	<p>Maybe one of the things I like is the decentralisation that the model would imply.  Rather than having one large distributor (Amazon) you have lots of smaller distributors (fans of Mike Marshall&#8217;s music).  Hmm, food for thought.</p>

                <p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been actively trying to unsubscribe from things that I&#8217;m no longer interested in.  Both electronic and traditional mail.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve started to keep a little <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/HomePage">record</a> of when I receive said shite and when I unsubscribe.</p>


	<p>Something I&#8217;ve learned over this short time.  The majority of companies make it very easy for you to signup to receive their shite.  It is almost always harder (if only by one step) to unsubscribe from the same material.  Why?  If I&#8217;m trying to unsubscribe it&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;m not interested in what you&#8217;re doing.  Why would you possibly want to make it hard for me to go.  Why not just add a second button to the form that makes it easy for me to subscribe.  This button would say &#8216;unsubscribe&#8217; and would do exactly that.  Easy huh.  Now, go do it The Companies.</p>


	<p>This reminds me that I think my contract is now up with <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/03/16/orange-orange-orange">Orange</a>.  Time to get myself a new provider me thinks.</p>


	<p>A nice positive blog post to start the day :-)</p>
