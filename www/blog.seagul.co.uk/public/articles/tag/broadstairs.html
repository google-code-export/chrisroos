                <p><a href="http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk">Printerior Design</a> are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanet">local</a> (to me, probably not to you) firm that produce cool pictures.  They are beautiful <a href="http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk/galleries.html">photos</a> printed directly onto heavy duty metal &#8211; &#8216;man-art&#8217; if you will.  I bought <a href="http://www.printeriordesign.co.uk/landscapes/pages/Dawn%201500%20thumbnail%20with%20drop%20shadow_jpg.htm">this one</a> as a Christmas present.</p>

	<p>The reason for this post is because a friend recently asked me where I got the picture.  Not remembering the name of the company, I started googling.  I knew that they had pictures in Harpers Wine Bar (I thought they had a website but I can&#8217;t find it) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadstairs">Broadstairs</a>, and in the <a href="http://www.albionbroadstairs.co.uk/">Albion Hotel</a>, also in Broadstairs.  I also knew that their workshop was on Pysons Road Industrial estate.  Sadly, even with this info, they just weren&#8217;t appearing in google.  So, I&#8217;m hoping that this might help them out a little bit.</p>


	<p>I can&#8217;t help but think that they&#8217;d benefit massively from a blog about their work &#8211; I&#8217;m of the belief that what they do is pretty different.</p>


	<p><strong>Update</strong> I&#8217;ve uploaded a copy of the picture I have to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> and embedded it in this post &#8211; hoping the printerior guys don&#8217;t mind too much&#8230;</p>
