                <p>A side effect of my <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> <a href="http://del.icio.us/chrisjroos">bookmarks</a> having <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/09/05/patching-the-del-icio-us-firefox-extension-to-add-permalinks">permalinks</a> is that you can, if you really really want, &#8216;comment&#8217; on them.  You just need to bookmark (in del.icio.us) my permalinked bookmark, write a comment in the notes field and tag it for:chrisjroos.  One small step to people being able to comment on anything they see (just an idea I&#8217;ve had bubbling for a while).</p>

                <p>This is obviously completely optional but if anyone stumbles across this post, I&#8217;d really appreciate it if you&#8217;d spend a few minutes checking out the revised <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">reevoo.com</a>.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t want to say too much as I want to influence any judgement.  Just check it out and let me know what you think, either in the comments here or by <a href="mailto:chrisroos@reevoo.com">email</a>.  Oh, and really don&#8217;t be scared to slag it off, praise it up or just sit on the fence &#8211; any opinion is welcome.</p>


	<p>Oh, and in case it&#8217;s not obvious, I work at Reevoo.</p>

                <p>I <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/05/17/pesky-scammers">wrote</a> a short while ago about receiving comments that were not obviously spam.  In the few weeks  between that post and this, I&#8217;ve received several more legitimate looking comments.  Tonight, I finally looked in some detail at the comments I&#8217;d received.  The comments were either very generic (&#8216;nice post&#8217; or &#8216;thanks for the info&#8217;) or were copied from previous comments on the site.  The &#8216;homepages&#8217; came in four different flavours.</p>


	<h3>Look like legitimate blogs but contain hidden content and porn links at the bottom of the page.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>moradblog.com</li>
		<li>fromgreghead.com</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Crappy web shops.  These only really caught my attention because they all look identical.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>camikon.com</li>
		<li>leaderdvd.com</li>
		<li>pet-supplies-store.info</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Look like legitimate blogs but are noticeable due to a complete lack of style and porn links at the bottom of the page.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>pinkyspaperhause.com</li>
		<li>timesofsooz.com</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Look like legitimate websites but a <code>site:&lt;website&gt;</code> search in google reveals lots of porn pages.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>smachex.info</li>
		<li>wampy.info</li>
		<li>www.valmux.com</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Oh, there is also one other site that I really cannot decide whether to classify as spam or not &#8211; ireadnews.net (sorry if you&#8217;re not spam).</p>


	<p>The addresses are here (and not linked to) for the benefit of anyone that happens to stumble across this page.  I&#8217;m actually quite amazed at the depth of some of these sites.  moradblog.com in particular has links to lots of &#8216;web 2.0&#8217; sites for &#8216;morad&#8217; (flickr, del.icio.us etc).  It makes me half wonder if they are actual spam sites or whether the site has been hijacked in some way..</p>
