                <p>Are Tesco Entertainment the new <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/03/16/orange-orange-orange">Orange</a>?  They might just be you know.  See, I&#8217;ve been sad and pathetic enough to <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions">record</a> details of unwanted emails that I receive.  So far <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment">Tesco Entertainment</a>, bless &#8216;em, have been unable to remove me from their mailing list for 90 days.  I thought I&#8217;d write them a little email to, you know, ask them to stop spamming me.</p>


<blockquote>
Here&#8217;s a list of emails you&#8217;ve sent me.

	<ul>
	<li>Received: 26-Jun-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 11-Jul-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 27-Jul-2007</li>
		<li><strong>Unsubscribed</strong>: 30-Jul-2007 (although it appeared that I wasn’t actually signed up to any offers…)</li>
		<li>Received: 08-Aug-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 21-Aug-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 16-Oct-2007</li>
		<li>I emailed you on 17th Oct:
“I unsubscribed from you guys on the 30th July 2007 (interestingly, my preferences suggested that I wasn’t actually subscribed to any mailings in the first place). Since then, you’ve sent me Tesco Entertainment emails on the 8th Aug, 21st Aug and 16th Oct1. Please stop.  Cheers,  Chris  [1] http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment”</li>
		<li>Received: 30-Oct-2007</li>
	</ul>


	<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I&#8217;ve received four emails since unsubscribing on the 30th July.  I think three months is long enough to remove someone from your spam list isn&#8217;t it?  Oh, and you&#8217;ll also see I&#8217;ve emailed you in the past too.  It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to reply would it?</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>


Chris

	<p><strong>Update Thu 15th Nov 2007</strong></p>


	<p>I received a reply from Tesco.</p>


<blockquote>

                <p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been actively trying to unsubscribe from things that I&#8217;m no longer interested in.  Both electronic and traditional mail.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve started to keep a little <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/HomePage">record</a> of when I receive said shite and when I unsubscribe.</p>


	<p>Something I&#8217;ve learned over this short time.  The majority of companies make it very easy for you to signup to receive their shite.  It is almost always harder (if only by one step) to unsubscribe from the same material.  Why?  If I&#8217;m trying to unsubscribe it&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;m not interested in what you&#8217;re doing.  Why would you possibly want to make it hard for me to go.  Why not just add a second button to the form that makes it easy for me to subscribe.  This button would say &#8216;unsubscribe&#8217; and would do exactly that.  Easy huh.  Now, go do it The Companies.</p>


	<p>This reminds me that I think my contract is now up with <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/03/16/orange-orange-orange">Orange</a>.  Time to get myself a new provider me thinks.</p>


	<p>A nice positive blog post to start the day :-)</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve received another innocent looking comment, &#8220;Hey man, thanks for article!&#8221;, this time from gribitonline.com.</p>


	<p>I followed the same procedure as <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/06/06/a-little-further-investigation-into-those-pesky-scammers">last time</a>  and found that this site contains  the same style porn links at the bottom of the page.  The site looks more genuine than all the others, hence the title &#8211; I&#8217;m really not sure whether this is intentional spam or whether it&#8217;s been hijacked.</p>


	<p>I did some investigation to see if I could find the provider of the porn links.  Unfortunately I&#8217;ve not found anything obvious, although I have noticed some patterns.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>The porn links are embedded within the body of the page and then moved to the bottom with the help of javascript.  I assume that this is an <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEO"><span class="caps">SEO</span></a> trick, based on the understanding that links in content are granted higher ratings than links just for navigation.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Site without javascript enabled</h3>


	<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1208/544423293_cdf567e9a2_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<h3>Site with javascript enabled</h3>


	<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1040/544325496_41bc3cb742_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<ul>
	<li>The javascript used to move the links always looks like this.</li>
	</ul>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">var el, el2;
el = document.getElementById('cbceddfd');
el2 = document.getElementById('cceedfda');
if (el &amp;&amp; el2)
el2.appendChild(el);
el = document.getElementById('bfabedba');
el2 = // ... and repeat</code></pre></div>

	<ul>
	<li>Each link is inserted into its own empty span at the bottom of the page.  The spans seem to have the same ids on each of the sites that have these type of links.  The first span is always cceedfda, the second is cecfaabe, with subsequent ids also being the same across different sites.  There doesn&#8217;t appear to be any other pattern to the ids.</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Sites from previous experiment that follow this pattern
	<ul>
	<li>timesofsooz.com</li>
		<li>pinkyspaperhause.com</li>
		<li>moradblog.com</li>
		<li>fromgreghead.com</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m really quite intrigued by these sites.  Sad, I know.</li>
	</ul>

                <p>I <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/05/17/pesky-scammers">wrote</a> a short while ago about receiving comments that were not obviously spam.  In the few weeks  between that post and this, I&#8217;ve received several more legitimate looking comments.  Tonight, I finally looked in some detail at the comments I&#8217;d received.  The comments were either very generic (&#8216;nice post&#8217; or &#8216;thanks for the info&#8217;) or were copied from previous comments on the site.  The &#8216;homepages&#8217; came in four different flavours.</p>


	<h3>Look like legitimate blogs but contain hidden content and porn links at the bottom of the page.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>moradblog.com</li>
		<li>fromgreghead.com</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Crappy web shops.  These only really caught my attention because they all look identical.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>camikon.com</li>
		<li>leaderdvd.com</li>
		<li>pet-supplies-store.info</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Look like legitimate blogs but are noticeable due to a complete lack of style and porn links at the bottom of the page.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>pinkyspaperhause.com</li>
		<li>timesofsooz.com</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Look like legitimate websites but a <code>site:&lt;website&gt;</code> search in google reveals lots of porn pages.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>smachex.info</li>
		<li>wampy.info</li>
		<li>www.valmux.com</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Oh, there is also one other site that I really cannot decide whether to classify as spam or not &#8211; ireadnews.net (sorry if you&#8217;re not spam).</p>


	<p>The addresses are here (and not linked to) for the benefit of anyone that happens to stumble across this page.  I&#8217;m actually quite amazed at the depth of some of these sites.  moradblog.com in particular has links to lots of &#8216;web 2.0&#8217; sites for &#8216;morad&#8217; (flickr, del.icio.us etc).  It makes me half wonder if they are actual spam sites or whether the site has been hijacked in some way..</p>

                <p>A couple of days ago, I received a comment to one of my articles.  &#8220;Hmm, that looks familiar I thought&#8221;, and not without good reason.  You see, the comment had been copied verbatim from another comment on the same article.  The only change was the author&#8217;s name and the url of their &#8216;homepage&#8217;.  After a little deliberation I deleted the comment.  I found it interesting for two reasons.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>The &#8216;homepage&#8217; link wasn&#8217;t obviously spam (it was some kind of kitchen site I believe), although a quick search did reveal it on some blacklists.</li>
		<li>I am unable to teach <a href="http://akismet.com/">akismet</a> (my current form of spam protection) to recognise these types of messages as spam, after all, the content itself is perfectly valid.</li>
	</ol>


	<p>Anyway, I got on with my life until, whoah, it happened again this morning.  Same article but a different comment had been copied.  The mystery continues&#8230; (at least, until I forget about it again).</p>


	<p>Anyone else experienced this?</p>
