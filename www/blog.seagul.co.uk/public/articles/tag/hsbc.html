                <p>I finally received a reply from <span class="caps">HSBC</span> to my constant nagging about a possible bug in their Internet Banking software.</p>


<blockquote>
Our reference : 5629320

	<p>Dear Mr Roos</p>


	<p>Thank you for your e-mail.</p>


	<p>As previously advised, this has been fed back to our Development Team however, we do not offer technical support for any financial packages.</p>


	<p>Our Internet Banking terms and conditions state that 
we will not be held responsible for any financial management software which you choose to use in connection with the Internet Banking service.</p>


	<p>Please be assured that all customer feedback is taken seriously, however we do receive many change requests for our electronic banking services every day.</p>


	<p>Each request is recorded to enable us to monitor the number received, these are then assessed for suitability and prioritised accordingly.</p>


	<p>Although your suggestion cannot be implemented immediately it will be held on our database.  We do advise our customers, via an online message, when upgrades have been made to our electronic banking services.</p>


I trust that this matter is now closed but would like to thank you for bringing this to our attention.
</blockquote>

	<p>So I replied in order to explain my persistence.</p>


<blockquote>
Hey,

	<p>I appreciate you getting back to me.</p>


	<p>To start with, although this causes me some problems, it&#8217;s not big deal.  The reason for my originally getting in touch was that I thought I might be able to help you guys.  I found what I believed to be a bug in your <span class="caps">OFX</span> export and thought that by reporting it with some fairly relevant context (i.e. the section of the <span class="caps">OFX</span> spec that explains what the <span class="caps">OFX</span> export should look like) that it might help you to get it prioritised.</p>


	<p>Your response of &#8220;we do not offer technical support for any financial packages&#8221; makes me think that you&#8217;re trying to shrug me off (I appreciate that this may not be the case).  You don&#8217;t need to offer support for financial packages but I would expect that when you boast of downloads in <span class="caps">OFX</span> format that they would actually follow the specification.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t know whether my approach is the normal approach people would take when reporting problems but I come from an open-source background where people generally help each other out.  Actually, out of interest, how do you &#8220;receive many change requests for our electronic banking services every day&#8221;?  Do other people submit their problems in the same way or was there a more obvious route that I missed?</p>


	<p>I guess I feel a little unsatisfied.  Because of the problems I&#8217;ve had getting in contact with anyone from the beginning I find myself not necessarily believing what you are telling me.  However, I do accept that this might not be fair and that you have indeed logged my bug report into your database.</p>


	<p>Feel completely free to ignore this suggestion but&#8230;  I think you would get a lot of unexpected benefits by making it easier to give feedback about your Internet Banking site.  I can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s just me that feels compelled to help out when they see a problem &#8211; I think you&#8217;d get an awful lot of useful feedback from others too.</p>


	<p>Anyway, I guess that&#8217;s it for now.  If there&#8217;s anything I can possibly help with then drop me an email &#8211; I&#8217;ll help out where I can.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m going to post this letter to my blog too<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>


	<p>Chris</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m sure that at some point in the future, <span class="caps">HSBC</span> will hire some consultants.  Those consultants will tell <span class="caps">HSBC</span> how to utilise the open source community to make the world a better place.  <span class="caps">HSBC</span> will listen because any advice you pay for has to be true&#8230;. Right?</p>

                <p>This will be of interest to very few (if any) people &#8211; I&#8217;d suggest you just move on to something more interesting.</p>


	<p>Yesterday, I contacted Hsbc using the Internet Banking feedback form that was outside of the Internet Banking site itself.</p>


<blockquote>
I believe that the Ofx export of transactions has been broken since your internet banking &#8216;upgrade&#8217;.  I&#8217;ve tried many times to contact you using My Messages and also over the phone &#8211; the people I seem to be dealing with are unable or unwilling to help.

	<p>It&#8217;s a very minor problem &#8211; my account is overdrawn yet the balance is shown as positive in the Ofx export.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve posted about the issue on my blog<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, in the hope that someone might provide me some contact details of someone that can actually help.  Unfortunately that didn&#8217;t get my anywhere.</p>


	<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>

	<p>I was hoping to get through to a human.  Unfortunately I just got the same copy and paste bot that I get from within the Internet banking site.</p>

Dear Mr Roos

	<p>Our Reference: 508-5629320-15102007-RR</p>


	<p>Thank you for using the feedback facility for our Internet Banking service.</p>


	<p>This is with regard to your recent e-mail concerning problems related to the download of transactions. From our experience to date, we have found that similar queries have been most effectively dealt with over the telephone rather than an exchange of a series of e-mails.</p>


	<p>On occasions it can be of benefit to be online whilst talking to us. You may wish to call from a separate line to your Internet connection.</p>


	<p>If you require further assistance, please call us on 0845 600 2290 (within UK) or +44 1226261226 (outside UK).  Minicom support is available on 0845 7125563.  The Internet Banking Helpdesk is open from Monday to Sunday 8.00am to 10.00pm (UK times).</p>

	<p>Tonight, I&#8217;ve emailed their complaints email address.</p>


<blockquote>
Hi,

	<p>I&#8217;ll apologise in advance for potentially mis-using your complaints email address.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve got a problem with downloading my transactions in Ofx format from the Internet banking site.  I&#8217;ve written up my experience so far<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  As a web developer with experience of the Ofx format I&#8217;m fairly sure that you&#8217;ve got a bug in your Internet banking site.  I&#8217;ve been trying for over a month to speak to someone in your support department to no avail.</p>


	<p>All I want is for you (or someone that is able to do more than hit copy, paste, send) to read the post below and pass this information on to your development team &#8211; they will be able to help.</p>


	<p>Be assured that I&#8217;m really just trying to help you guys.  If you need anything else from me then just give me a shout.</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m almost 100% certain that there&#8217;s a <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/247143372">bug</a> in the Hsbc Internet Banking site.</p>


	<p>My account is overdrawn yet the balance shows as positive when I download my transactions in either &#8216;Money 98 onwards (ofx)&#8217; or &#8216;Quicken 2002 (ofx)&#8217;.  I believe that section 3.2.9.2 of the <a href="http://www.ofx.net">Ofx</a> 2.1.1 spec explains that these balances should be shown as negative.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve tried to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=31365693@N00&#38;q=hsbc+AND+ofx&#38;m=tags">email</a> and I&#8217;ve <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279942352">tried</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279956472">to</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313632312">call</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313656682">hsbc</a>.  Both to no avail.</p>


	<p>Does anyone know anyone that works at Hsbc and might be able to get a message to someone in development?  If not, what&#8217;s the etiquette on facebook groups?  I notice that there a few hsbc groups &#8211; can I just post messages to them asking for help?</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve gotten so used to dealing with <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">real</a> companies that I&#8217;d forgotten how the old world works.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve updated my <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/12/24/curl-is-fast-becoming-my-favourite-toy">previous</a> curl/ruby script to automatically download my most recent transactions from Hsbc.  I created the original script as I had a couple of hours spare and wanted to see if I could do it.  The update has been driven by my continued use of <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">wesabe</a>.  Not only does it make my life a bit easier (which is, after all, the point of software) but the wesabe guys have suggested that they may be able to roll it into their client.  Cool.</p>


	<p>As an aside.  It really, really, really shouldn&#8217;t be as hard as it is to automatically get a downloaded list of my transactions.  At least Hsbc offer transactions in <a href="http://www.ofx.net">ofx</a> format, unlike <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/04/01/converting-egg-credit-card-statements-to-ofx-for-upload-to-wesabe">egg</a> and <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg-ofx/ing_direct">ing direct</a>.  Come on, The Banks, sort it out eh.</p>

                <p>I needed to pay some money to <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk"><span class="caps">HMRC</span></a> to cover my tax.  <span class="caps">HMRC</span> kindly supply me with their sort code and account number so that I could transfer the money directly from my bank account.  Logged into <a href="http://www.hsbc.co.uk">Hsbc</a>, I entered the relevant details and tried to make the payment.  Instead of going through like a good payment should, I was presented with this useless error message.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We are unable to deal with your request. Please call us on 0845 600 2290 quoting reference 841, and we will be happy to help.  Select an option from the left-hand menu to continue.&#8221;</p>


	<p>I happen to know that, in English, this means, &#8220;You have tried to make a payment to a known bank account using the Friends and Family option.  You&#8217;re a dumbass.  It&#8217;s obvious that instead of blindly typing in the sort code and account number, you should select from this helpful list of accounts that we already know about.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Hmm, now if only I knew which of 12 cryptic names to choose I&#8217;d be away&#8230;  Anyway.  A short phone call later, filled with such insights as &#8220;lots of people seem to phone up about this&#8221;, and, &#8220;we can&#8217;t give out the list of names vs sort codes as it&#8217;s against data protection&#8221;, I was all set.  For anyone that cares, the sort code and account number I had (10-50-41 and 23456000) match to the incredibly obvious &#8216;HMRC <span class="caps">CORP TAX SHIP</span>&#8217;.  Actually, I&#8217;ve just come across a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/howtopay/bank-account-checker.htm">page</a> detailing all the different <span class="caps">HMRC</span> accounts and what they&#8217;re for.  A quick scan suggests that you can probably derive the cryptic Hsbc name from the more human friendly name on that page.</p>


	<p>If anyone happens to come across this page while searching for the error above, maybe you could leave details in the comments of the sort code, account number and Hsbc cryptic name, in order to help out any future visitors.</p>

                <h3>(or programmatically logging into online banking to retrieve my balance)</h3>


	<p>In order to make practical use<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> of my new found <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/12/14/addicted-to-twitter-com">sms gateway</a>, I&#8217;ve created a ruby script that logs into my hsbc bank account and scrapes the balance from the screen.</p>
