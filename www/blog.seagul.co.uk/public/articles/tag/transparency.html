                <p>This started out as a few paragraphs at the end of the <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/26/it-should-be-easy-to-cancel-online-accounts">previous post</a> but I thought it better suited on it&#8217;s own.</p>


	<p>In my current thinking, I basically equate transparency with confidence.  Traditionally, people don&#8217;t tell you how much things cost (a sweeping statement I know).  They may have example prices that can be negotiated on, advertised prices with small print (that alters the same) or just try very hard to hide the pricing altogether<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  I believe that if you&#8217;re confident in your product/service you will have no reason to obfuscate the price (in these and other ways).  If you don&#8217;t have to disguise your price then you are able to place it very prominently on your site.  It turns out to be the same folks prominently <a href="http://www.strongspace.com/plans">displaying</a> <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/signup">their</a> <a href="http://www.dropsend.com/pricingsignup.php">pricing</a> also making it very easy to cancel your account (see now how it links to the previous post?).</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m thinking that you have to be pretty confident to offer this level of transparency in your product/service; hence my initial statement.  As a slight aside/addition, most of the services that are following this style (is it coincidence they seem to be web 2.0/agile folks?) also offer free versions of their services which again indicates their confidence.</p>


	<p>Transparency as a buzzword seems to increasing in popularity with the folks at <a href="http://www.riffs.com">riffs</a> even using it to describe their <a href="http://www.riffs.com/doc.cgi?section=privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s probably meaning somewhere in this disjointed ramble but having just re-read it I&#8217;m not so sure.  Maybe I&#8217;ll revisit it at some point, but then again, maybe I wont; we&#8217;ll see.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> This was particularly annoying just recently when I was looking for a new broadband provider.  Of all the websites I visited, I don&#8217;t recall being able to find conclusive pricing on any of them.  Some would quote a monthly price but actually expect a year up front while other&#8217;s might quote a genuine monthly cost but then make it very difficult to find minimum contract terms, and even more difficult to find the cost of breaking those terms.</p>
