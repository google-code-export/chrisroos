                <p>I was in need of finding some train times at the weekend.  I usually use the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk">national rail enquiries</a> website but was without Internet access at the time.  Instead, I found myself waiting for about 10 minutes in a telephone queue just to spend about 30 seconds getting the information I was after.  This played on my mind a bit so last night I started <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/164273922">playing around</a> with automating the national rail timetable search.  That was relatively painless so I moved on to integrating with <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a> in order to provide an <span class="caps">SMS</span> interface to the service.  Within a couple of hours I had a twitterbot that receives timetable requests, looks up the times and sends them back to you.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s actually currently all up and running.  Just follow <a href="http://twitter.com/natrailenq">natrailenq</a> on twitter and I&#8217;ll follow you right back<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> (this seems to be necessary in order to send direct messages between each other).  A timetable request must be of the format &#8216;origin_station (3 letter short code) destination_station (3 letter short code) depart_date (dd-mmmm) depart_time (hh:mm)&#8217;.  So, if we wanted to get times of trains from London Victoria (VIC) to Clapham Junction (CLJ) tomorrow midday, we&#8217;d send a message like so:</p>


<code>d natrailenq vic clj 25-july 12:00</code>

	<p>In this instance, we get the following response back.</p>


<code>natrailenq  11:55-&gt;12:02, 12:02-&gt;12:07, 12:03-&gt;12:09, 12:05-&gt;12:11, 12:06-&gt;12:11</code>

	<p>Cool huh.</p>


	<p>The code is <strong>nasty</strong>.  You can see just how nasty it in the <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nat-rail-enq/">repository</a>.  It feels as though this could go somewhere &#8211; unless I&#8217;m violating some terms and conditions that I haven&#8217;t read&#8230;  I make no guarantees as to how long the service will stay live, and I will certainly (probably) remove it if asked to.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Well, just as soon as I can at least &#8211; it&#8217;s not automated at the moment.</p>
