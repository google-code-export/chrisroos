                <p>I wanted to get my thoughts down more than trying to write something particularly coherent so I apologise for the unstructured post.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to get this working for the last week or so, without much success.</p>


	<p>The first problem I ran into was my general impatience and incompetence.  I was able to receive emails to my 3mail.com address but sending of emails was not working (attachment or not).  I struggled alone for a bit before heading for the instruction manual and realising that I hadn&#8217;t actually configured my email settings.</p>


	<p>I needed to change the username (from the default &#8216;3Mail&#8217; to my mobile number) and the password (to the four digit code set-up at some point during the enrollment process).  I also changed the Mail address to my 3mail.com address but I&#8217;m not sure whether this was necessary or not.  Changing these settings allowed me to send email (I started by emailing my personal account).  As I was successfully receiving emails before these changes I can only assume that the username and password are required for <span class="caps">SMTP</span> and that <span class="caps">IMAP</span> authentication happens in some other, magical, way.</p>


	<p>The 3mail service appears to use standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol"><span class="caps">IMAP</span></a> (imap.three.co.uk) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></a> servers but I&#8217;m guessing that access is restricted by IP address.  I certainly couldn&#8217;t access them from my laptop on the end of an <span class="caps">ADSL</span> connection.</p>


	<p>I was monitoring the costs of the emails being sent and soon realised that every email that included a picture cost fifty pence.  I sent a simple text email with a tiny subject and body and it didn&#8217;t affect my credit at all so I&#8217;m not entirely sure of their charging model (it could be that I pay for attachments or just messages over a certain size).  I wondered whether the data used in sending the email would come out of an Internet bundles.  I purchased a fifty pence, one day, Internet bundle and sent another message: my credit decreased by fifty pence again.  D&#8217;oh.</p>


	<p>It might be useful to note that you can send one email to multiple recipients (I tried two) for the same price (fifty pence for the email with picture that I was sending).</p>


	<p>I emailed the same photo to <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> twice, cc&#8217;ing my personal address one occasion.  Neither email made it to flickr (well, it&#8217;s difficult to know that for sure but it certainly didn&#8217;t show up) but the email cc&#8217;d to me came through fine.  To ensure that &#8216;email to flickr&#8217; was working correctly, I sent the picture I&#8217;d just received to my flickr email address (copied from the email) and it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2199297357/">showed up</a> almost immediately.  Hmm, so I&#8217;ve now wasted a couple of quid and still can&#8217;t email my photos to flickr.</p>


	<p>I was able to send the message as a picture message to flickr (and my personal email) at a cost of twenty-five pence.  There are two (smallish) downsides to this approach: the pictures are resized to 640&#215;480 before sending and, as it goes through an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service"><span class="caps">MMS</span></a> to email translation phase, the email you receive doesn&#8217;t have the subject and body set correctly (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2199389895/">screenshot</a>).</p>
