                <p>I finally received a reply from <span class="caps">HSBC</span> to my constant nagging about a possible bug in their Internet Banking software.</p>


<blockquote>
Our reference : 5629320

	<p>Dear Mr Roos</p>


	<p>Thank you for your e-mail.</p>


	<p>As previously advised, this has been fed back to our Development Team however, we do not offer technical support for any financial packages.</p>


	<p>Our Internet Banking terms and conditions state that 
we will not be held responsible for any financial management software which you choose to use in connection with the Internet Banking service.</p>


	<p>Please be assured that all customer feedback is taken seriously, however we do receive many change requests for our electronic banking services every day.</p>


	<p>Each request is recorded to enable us to monitor the number received, these are then assessed for suitability and prioritised accordingly.</p>


	<p>Although your suggestion cannot be implemented immediately it will be held on our database.  We do advise our customers, via an online message, when upgrades have been made to our electronic banking services.</p>


I trust that this matter is now closed but would like to thank you for bringing this to our attention.
</blockquote>

	<p>So I replied in order to explain my persistence.</p>


<blockquote>
Hey,

	<p>I appreciate you getting back to me.</p>


	<p>To start with, although this causes me some problems, it&#8217;s not big deal.  The reason for my originally getting in touch was that I thought I might be able to help you guys.  I found what I believed to be a bug in your <span class="caps">OFX</span> export and thought that by reporting it with some fairly relevant context (i.e. the section of the <span class="caps">OFX</span> spec that explains what the <span class="caps">OFX</span> export should look like) that it might help you to get it prioritised.</p>


	<p>Your response of &#8220;we do not offer technical support for any financial packages&#8221; makes me think that you&#8217;re trying to shrug me off (I appreciate that this may not be the case).  You don&#8217;t need to offer support for financial packages but I would expect that when you boast of downloads in <span class="caps">OFX</span> format that they would actually follow the specification.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t know whether my approach is the normal approach people would take when reporting problems but I come from an open-source background where people generally help each other out.  Actually, out of interest, how do you &#8220;receive many change requests for our electronic banking services every day&#8221;?  Do other people submit their problems in the same way or was there a more obvious route that I missed?</p>


	<p>I guess I feel a little unsatisfied.  Because of the problems I&#8217;ve had getting in contact with anyone from the beginning I find myself not necessarily believing what you are telling me.  However, I do accept that this might not be fair and that you have indeed logged my bug report into your database.</p>


	<p>Feel completely free to ignore this suggestion but&#8230;  I think you would get a lot of unexpected benefits by making it easier to give feedback about your Internet Banking site.  I can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s just me that feels compelled to help out when they see a problem &#8211; I think you&#8217;d get an awful lot of useful feedback from others too.</p>


	<p>Anyway, I guess that&#8217;s it for now.  If there&#8217;s anything I can possibly help with then drop me an email &#8211; I&#8217;ll help out where I can.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m going to post this letter to my blog too<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>


	<p>Chris</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m sure that at some point in the future, <span class="caps">HSBC</span> will hire some consultants.  Those consultants will tell <span class="caps">HSBC</span> how to utilise the open source community to make the world a better place.  <span class="caps">HSBC</span> will listen because any advice you pay for has to be true&#8230;. Right?</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m almost 100% certain that there&#8217;s a <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/247143372">bug</a> in the Hsbc Internet Banking site.</p>


	<p>My account is overdrawn yet the balance shows as positive when I download my transactions in either &#8216;Money 98 onwards (ofx)&#8217; or &#8216;Quicken 2002 (ofx)&#8217;.  I believe that section 3.2.9.2 of the <a href="http://www.ofx.net">Ofx</a> 2.1.1 spec explains that these balances should be shown as negative.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve tried to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=31365693@N00&#38;q=hsbc+AND+ofx&#38;m=tags">email</a> and I&#8217;ve <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279942352">tried</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279956472">to</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313632312">call</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313656682">hsbc</a>.  Both to no avail.</p>


	<p>Does anyone know anyone that works at Hsbc and might be able to get a message to someone in development?  If not, what&#8217;s the etiquette on facebook groups?  I notice that there a few hsbc groups &#8211; can I just post messages to them asking for help?</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve gotten so used to dealing with <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">real</a> companies that I&#8217;d forgotten how the old world works.</p>

                <p>Tuttety tut tut tut.  I unsubscribed from you guys, don&#8217;t you <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/01/12/move-over-seetickets-com-youve-got-nothing-on-orange-co-uk">remember</a>?

	<p>Unless I&#8217;m very much mistaken, there have been about two months between the 12th January and now, one month more than the, err, very reasonable<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, 28 days they say it should take.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> It&#8217;s not reasonable.  In fact, I may go as far as to say it&#8217;s unjustifiable.</p>

                <p>I needed to pay some money to <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk"><span class="caps">HMRC</span></a> to cover my tax.  <span class="caps">HMRC</span> kindly supply me with their sort code and account number so that I could transfer the money directly from my bank account.  Logged into <a href="http://www.hsbc.co.uk">Hsbc</a>, I entered the relevant details and tried to make the payment.  Instead of going through like a good payment should, I was presented with this useless error message.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We are unable to deal with your request. Please call us on 0845 600 2290 quoting reference 841, and we will be happy to help.  Select an option from the left-hand menu to continue.&#8221;</p>


	<p>I happen to know that, in English, this means, &#8220;You have tried to make a payment to a known bank account using the Friends and Family option.  You&#8217;re a dumbass.  It&#8217;s obvious that instead of blindly typing in the sort code and account number, you should select from this helpful list of accounts that we already know about.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Hmm, now if only I knew which of 12 cryptic names to choose I&#8217;d be away&#8230;  Anyway.  A short phone call later, filled with such insights as &#8220;lots of people seem to phone up about this&#8221;, and, &#8220;we can&#8217;t give out the list of names vs sort codes as it&#8217;s against data protection&#8221;, I was all set.  For anyone that cares, the sort code and account number I had (10-50-41 and 23456000) match to the incredibly obvious &#8216;HMRC <span class="caps">CORP TAX SHIP</span>&#8217;.  Actually, I&#8217;ve just come across a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/howtopay/bank-account-checker.htm">page</a> detailing all the different <span class="caps">HMRC</span> accounts and what they&#8217;re for.  A quick scan suggests that you can probably derive the cryptic Hsbc name from the more human friendly name on that page.</p>


	<p>If anyone happens to come across this page while searching for the error above, maybe you could leave details in the comments of the sort code, account number and Hsbc cryptic name, in order to help out any future visitors.</p>

	<p>And, from a <a href="http://www.shozu.com">site</a> that requires your mobile number as part of the signup process &#8211; seems to me that they&#8217;d be better off using that to filter automated signups.</p>


	<p>I hate captchas.</p>

                <p>So, it seems far more difficult than it should be to retrieve a bunch of <strong>my</strong> photos from flickr.com.  Having unsuccessfully experimented with some of the flickr libs on <a href="http://www.rubyforge.org">rubyforge</a> I hacked this together.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong>: Something caused curl to get &#8216;stuck&#8217; downloading a particular picture so I amended the script to ensure it ignores already downloaded files.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE 2</span></strong>: Surround output filename with quotes.</p>
