                <p>I finally received a reply from <span class="caps">HSBC</span> to my constant nagging about a possible bug in their Internet Banking software.</p>


<blockquote>
Our reference : 5629320

	<p>Dear Mr Roos</p>


	<p>Thank you for your e-mail.</p>


	<p>As previously advised, this has been fed back to our Development Team however, we do not offer technical support for any financial packages.</p>


	<p>Our Internet Banking terms and conditions state that 
we will not be held responsible for any financial management software which you choose to use in connection with the Internet Banking service.</p>


	<p>Please be assured that all customer feedback is taken seriously, however we do receive many change requests for our electronic banking services every day.</p>


	<p>Each request is recorded to enable us to monitor the number received, these are then assessed for suitability and prioritised accordingly.</p>


	<p>Although your suggestion cannot be implemented immediately it will be held on our database.  We do advise our customers, via an online message, when upgrades have been made to our electronic banking services.</p>


I trust that this matter is now closed but would like to thank you for bringing this to our attention.
</blockquote>

	<p>So I replied in order to explain my persistence.</p>


<blockquote>
Hey,

	<p>I appreciate you getting back to me.</p>


	<p>To start with, although this causes me some problems, it&#8217;s not big deal.  The reason for my originally getting in touch was that I thought I might be able to help you guys.  I found what I believed to be a bug in your <span class="caps">OFX</span> export and thought that by reporting it with some fairly relevant context (i.e. the section of the <span class="caps">OFX</span> spec that explains what the <span class="caps">OFX</span> export should look like) that it might help you to get it prioritised.</p>


	<p>Your response of &#8220;we do not offer technical support for any financial packages&#8221; makes me think that you&#8217;re trying to shrug me off (I appreciate that this may not be the case).  You don&#8217;t need to offer support for financial packages but I would expect that when you boast of downloads in <span class="caps">OFX</span> format that they would actually follow the specification.</p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t know whether my approach is the normal approach people would take when reporting problems but I come from an open-source background where people generally help each other out.  Actually, out of interest, how do you &#8220;receive many change requests for our electronic banking services every day&#8221;?  Do other people submit their problems in the same way or was there a more obvious route that I missed?</p>


	<p>I guess I feel a little unsatisfied.  Because of the problems I&#8217;ve had getting in contact with anyone from the beginning I find myself not necessarily believing what you are telling me.  However, I do accept that this might not be fair and that you have indeed logged my bug report into your database.</p>


	<p>Feel completely free to ignore this suggestion but&#8230;  I think you would get a lot of unexpected benefits by making it easier to give feedback about your Internet Banking site.  I can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s just me that feels compelled to help out when they see a problem &#8211; I think you&#8217;d get an awful lot of useful feedback from others too.</p>


	<p>Anyway, I guess that&#8217;s it for now.  If there&#8217;s anything I can possibly help with then drop me an email &#8211; I&#8217;ll help out where I can.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m going to post this letter to my blog too<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>


	<p>Chris</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m sure that at some point in the future, <span class="caps">HSBC</span> will hire some consultants.  Those consultants will tell <span class="caps">HSBC</span> how to utilise the open source community to make the world a better place.  <span class="caps">HSBC</span> will listen because any advice you pay for has to be true&#8230;. Right?</p>

                <p>This will be of interest to very few (if any) people &#8211; I&#8217;d suggest you just move on to something more interesting.</p>


	<p>Yesterday, I contacted Hsbc using the Internet Banking feedback form that was outside of the Internet Banking site itself.</p>


<blockquote>
I believe that the Ofx export of transactions has been broken since your internet banking &#8216;upgrade&#8217;.  I&#8217;ve tried many times to contact you using My Messages and also over the phone &#8211; the people I seem to be dealing with are unable or unwilling to help.

	<p>It&#8217;s a very minor problem &#8211; my account is overdrawn yet the balance is shown as positive in the Ofx export.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve posted about the issue on my blog<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, in the hope that someone might provide me some contact details of someone that can actually help.  Unfortunately that didn&#8217;t get my anywhere.</p>


	<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>

	<p>I was hoping to get through to a human.  Unfortunately I just got the same copy and paste bot that I get from within the Internet banking site.</p>

	<p>On occasions it can be of benefit to be online whilst talking to us. You may wish to call from a separate line to your Internet connection.</p>


	<p>If you require further assistance, please call us on 0845 600 2290 (within UK) or +44 1226261226 (outside UK).  Minicom support is available on 0845 7125563.  The Internet Banking Helpdesk is open from Monday to Sunday 8.00am to 10.00pm (UK times).</p>

	<p>Tonight, I&#8217;ve emailed their complaints email address.</p>


<blockquote>
Hi,

	<p>I&#8217;ll apologise in advance for potentially mis-using your complaints email address.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve got a problem with downloading my transactions in Ofx format from the Internet banking site.  I&#8217;ve written up my experience so far<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  As a web developer with experience of the Ofx format I&#8217;m fairly sure that you&#8217;ve got a bug in your Internet banking site.  I&#8217;ve been trying for over a month to speak to someone in your support department to no avail.</p>


	<p>All I want is for you (or someone that is able to do more than hit copy, paste, send) to read the post below and pass this information on to your development team &#8211; they will be able to help.</p>


	<p>Be assured that I&#8217;m really just trying to help you guys.  If you need anything else from me then just give me a shout.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m almost 100% certain that there&#8217;s a <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/247143372">bug</a> in the Hsbc Internet Banking site.</p>


	<p>My account is overdrawn yet the balance shows as positive when I download my transactions in either &#8216;Money 98 onwards (ofx)&#8217; or &#8216;Quicken 2002 (ofx)&#8217;.  I believe that section 3.2.9.2 of the <a href="http://www.ofx.net">Ofx</a> 2.1.1 spec explains that these balances should be shown as negative.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve tried to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=31365693@N00&#38;q=hsbc+AND+ofx&#38;m=tags">email</a> and I&#8217;ve <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279942352">tried</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279956472">to</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313632312">call</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313656682">hsbc</a>.  Both to no avail.</p>


	<p>Does anyone know anyone that works at Hsbc and might be able to get a message to someone in development?  If not, what&#8217;s the etiquette on facebook groups?  I notice that there a few hsbc groups &#8211; can I just post messages to them asking for help?</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve gotten so used to dealing with <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">real</a> companies that I&#8217;d forgotten how the old world works.</p>

                <p>I wanted to <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/06/23/automatically-download-egg-credit-card-transactions">automate</a> the <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/05/14/automatically-downloading-my-recent-transactions-from-lloyds-tsb">download</a> of <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/05/04/automatically-downloading-my-most-recent-hsbc-transactions">transaction</a> data for my <a href="http://www.ingdirect.co.uk">ing direct</a> account.  Instead of just pasting up the finished result, I&#8217;ve tried to capture the process I went through, on the off chance it&#8217;s of interest to anyone&#8230;</p>


	<h3>Earlier</h3>


	<p>Open the <a href="http://www.ingdirect.co.uk">homepage</a></p>


	<p>Click the login link. (goes to https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/InitialINGDirect.html?command=displayLogin&#38;device=web&#38;locale=en_GB)</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/601727552/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1358/601727552_238151d7e8_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>Type our Customer Number and Last Name into the login form.</p>


	<p>Before submitting the form, we open the <a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">Live Http headers</a> <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">firefox</a> extension.</p>


	<p>We see that the following information gets POSTed to InitialINGDirect.html</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">command=enterCustomerNumber&amp;locale=en_GB&amp;device=web&amp;ACN=&lt;YOUR_CUSTOMER_NUMBER&gt;&amp;LNAME=&lt;YOUR_LAST_NAME&gt;&amp;GO.x=23&amp;GO.y=12</code></pre></div>

	<p>We are redirected to a second security page.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/601727868/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1344/601727868_4569c11af6_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>The first use of <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> is to see whether we can get this far from the command line.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">curl -X&quot;POST&quot; -d&quot;command=enterCustomerNumber&quot; -d&quot;locale=en_GB&quot; -d&quot;device=web&quot; -d&quot;ACN=YOUR_CUSTOMER_NUMBER&quot; -d&quot;LNAME=YOUR_LAST_NAME&quot; -d&quot;GO.x=23&quot; -d&quot;GO.y=12&quot; &quot;https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/InitialINGDirect.html&quot; -o&quot;&lt;FILENAME_FOR_OUTPUT&gt;&quot;</code></pre></div>

	<p>The actual output in this instance is</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
location.replace(&quot;/INGDirect.html?command=displayValidateCustomer&amp;fill=1&quot;);
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</code></pre></div>

	<p>So we amend the curl command to see exactly what&#8217;s going on (the removal of -o and the addition of -v)</p>


	<p>Right, so this is interesting &#8211; I was expecting to see an <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30"><span class="caps">HTTP</span> Location</a> header directing us to the second security page.  Instead the body of the response is the javascript seen above.  I guess they want to ensure that we have javascript enabled eh.</p>


	<p>Let&#8217;s just see what happens if we request the page returned in the javascript (https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/INGDirect.html?command=displayValidateCustomer&#38;fill=1)</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/601442615/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1130/601442615_2ce8dafc21_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>Ok, so that&#8217;s not unexpected.  How about, if we store the cookies sent to us in the original response, and then request the page returned in the javascript.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">curl -X&quot;POST&quot; -c&quot;/Users/chrisroos/Desktop/ing-cookie&quot; -d&quot;command=enterCustomerNumber&quot; -d&quot;locale=en_GB&quot; -d&quot;device=web&quot; -d&quot;ACN=YOUR_CUSTOMER_NUMBER&quot; -d&quot;LNAME=YOUR_LAST_NAME&quot; -d&quot;GO.x=23&quot; -d&quot;GO.y=12&quot; &quot;https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/InitialINGDirect.html&quot;

curl -b&quot;/Users/chrisroos/Desktop/ing-cookie&quot; &quot;https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/INGDirect.html?command=displayValidateCustomer&amp;fill=1&quot; -o&quot;/Users/chrisroos/Desktop/ing.html&quot;</code></pre></div>

	<p>Ok, this looks promising.  We can now proceed to the second security page.</p>


	<p>Let&#8217;s use firefox to log in and get to the second security page again.  Fill in the details as requested, open live http headers and get hold of the data we are sending.  Right, so we <span class="caps">POST</span> the following details to InitialINGDirect.html</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">command=validateCustomer&amp;locale=en_GB&amp;device=web&amp;PIN_A=5&amp;PIN_B=1&amp;PIN_C=4&amp;DAYS=65&amp;MONTHS=65&amp;YEARS=66&amp;GO.x=41&amp;GO.y=9</code></pre></div>

	<p>Ah, so this looks interesting.  It seems that each key on the keypad is assigned a number (potentially different to the number displayed on the key).  It is that number that gets sent.  The numbers on the keypad appear in a random order, so I wonder if the same number is always assigned to the same key, or whether something else is required to tell the server the order of the keys.  Let&#8217;s log in one more time and see if the results differ.  The assumption being that if they do then the server must know what order the keys have been displayed in.</p>


	<p>Bugger &#8211; now it won&#8217;t let me log in anymore (too many failed attempts) and I have to call the call centre.  Ooops.</p>


	<h3>Later</h3>


	<p>Right, so it&#8217;s now about 5 weeks after starting this investigation.  I&#8217;m going to attempt to pick up where I left off and see if we can&#8217;t get it finished.  Previously, before I got locked out of my account, I was going to test whether each digit on the keypad got assigned a different number each time.  In order to test, I logged into my account twice.  Each time, I saved the content of the page containing the keypad, and the output from Live Http Headers.  A quick examination of the differences between the output seems to suggest that we only ever send the position of a number on the keypad.  A made-up example might help to make this clear, starting with a keypad in no particular order.</p>


<pre>
5 1 2
4 7 3
0 8 9
  6
</pre>

	<p>If our pin number is 1234 and we are asked for the first digit then, although we would push the button labeled 1 on the keypad, we would actually send the value 2 to the server.  The buttons (but not the values they represent) all have a constant position, where the top-left button is position 1, the bottom-right is position 9 and the bottom button is position 0 (same layout as phone keypads).  For the above example, the button labeled 1 is in position 2, hence us sending a 2 to the server.</p>


	<p>Right, so unless I&#8217;m missing something, the server must &#8216;know&#8217; which three digits we&#8217;re being asked for, along with the order of the keypad.  If we&#8217;re to log in automatically then we&#8217;re going to need to parse the text that asks us for certain digits and determine the order of the keypad.  A little experimentation with <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/">hpricot</a> yielded the following code.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_ruby"><span class="ident">require</span> <span class="punct">'</span><span class="string">rubygems</span><span class="punct">'</span>
<span class="ident">require</span> <span class="punct">'</span><span class="string">hpricot</span><span class="punct">'</span>

<span class="ident">html</span> <span class="punct">=</span> <span class="constant">File</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">open</span><span class="punct">('</span><span class="string">/Users/chrisroos/Desktop/ingdirect-b1.html</span><span class="punct">')</span> <span class="punct">{</span> <span class="punct">|</span><span class="ident">f</span><span class="punct">|</span> <span class="ident">f</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">read</span> <span class="punct">}</span>

<span class="comment"># The request for our PIN digits appears within the following text</span>
<span class="comment"># &lt;b&gt;Using the Key Pad, please enter the 3rd, 5th and 2nd digits from your PIN&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="ident">pin_a</span><span class="punct">,</span> <span class="ident">pin_b</span><span class="punct">,</span> <span class="ident">pin_c</span> <span class="punct">=</span> <span class="ident">html</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">scan</span><span class="punct">(/</span><span class="regex">Using the Key Pad, please enter the (<span class="escape">\d</span>).+?(<span class="escape">\d</span>).+?(<span class="escape">\d</span>).*?&lt;<span class="escape">\/</span>b&gt;</span><span class="punct">/).</span><span class="ident">flatten</span>

<span class="comment"># Ok, now let's find the order of the keypad (hey, it's in a div with id pin-pad - cool)</span>
<span class="comment"># This has turned out quite trivial.  The keypad is rendered within an html table, where each cell contains a button (input)</span>
<span class="comment"># that has a value of the number displayed on the button.  Hpricot makes it very easy to say 'get me all buttons (input)</span>
<span class="comment"># that appear in cells within the table that is in the div with an id of pin-pad'.  As hpricot will parse the html table</span>
<span class="comment"># 'in order', i.e. from top-left to bottom right, we just have to append each button value into an array, preserving the</span>
<span class="comment"># order of the keypad.</span>
<span class="ident">doc</span> <span class="punct">=</span> <span class="constant">Hpricot</span><span class="punct">(</span><span class="ident">html</span><span class="punct">)</span>
<span class="ident">keypad</span> <span class="punct">=</span> <span class="punct">(</span><span class="ident">doc</span><span class="punct">/'</span><span class="string">div#pin-pad/table/tr/td/input</span><span class="punct">').</span><span class="ident">inject</span><span class="punct">([])</span> <span class="punct">{</span> <span class="punct">|</span><span class="ident">array</span><span class="punct">,</span> <span class="ident">btn</span><span class="punct">|</span> <span class="ident">array</span> <span class="punct">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="ident">btn</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">attributes</span><span class="punct">['</span><span class="string">value</span><span class="punct">'].</span><span class="ident">to_i</span><span class="punct">;</span> <span class="ident">array</span> <span class="punct">}</span>
<span class="comment"># The last value read from the html keypad table will appear at index 9 (our array is 0 based), where we actually want it to </span>
<span class="comment"># appear at index 0 (keypad is in phone keypad order, i.e. 0 at bottom).  Luckily, we can just pop it off the end and</span>
<span class="comment"># prepend it to the array</span>
<span class="ident">keypad</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">unshift</span><span class="punct">(</span><span class="ident">keypad</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">pop</span><span class="punct">)</span>
<span class="comment"># So, we can now convert a keypad like this</span>
<span class="comment"># 5 1 2</span>
<span class="comment"># 4 7 3</span>
<span class="comment"># 0 8 9</span>
<span class="comment">#   6</span>
<span class="comment"># into the equivalent ruby array [6, 5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 3, 0, 8, 9]</span>
<span class="comment"># We can then use Array#index to dive in grab the keypad position of a number</span>
<span class="comment"># keypad.index(5) #=&gt; 1</span>
<span class="comment"># keypad.index(7) #=&gt; 5</span></code></pre></div>

	<p>Cool, so we should be able to string together what we have and automatically login to our account, we need to dip into ruby so that we might parse the keypad page using our code above.</p>


	<p>Right, I&#8217;ve cobbled the code together but instead of seeing an account overview page, I&#8217;m actually receiving a page with more javascript relocation magic.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
location.replace(&quot;/InitialINGDirect.html?command=displayLoggedOutError&amp;locale=en_GB&amp;device=web&quot;);
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</code></pre></div>

	<p>I&#8217;m wondering if I&#8217;m missing some cookies &#8211; maybe some more cookies get added to the jar on the keypad page.  Using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60">web developer extension</a> this is trivial to check.  Two cookies are set when we first visit the login page&#8230;  Hmm, and there are still two when we get to the keypad page.  So something else is different.  Ok, so I found it.  Somehow, I&#8217;d managed to miss out some data that was required for the login to work correctly.  I was not sending the command=validateCustomer key/pair even though I&#8217;d already pasted it once above.  Oh well.  With this &#8216;command&#8217; added, we still get a page with some javascript relocation but this time we get relocated to the account summary..</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
location.replace(&quot;/INGDirect.html?command=accountSummary&amp;locale=en_GB&amp;device=web&amp;method=fetchClientAccountSummary&quot;);
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</code></pre></div>

	<p>If we finally <span class="caps">GET</span> this page then we should be able to &#8216;see&#8217; our account overview on the command line.  Of course it wasn&#8217;t that simple.  This just yields another javascript redirect.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
location.replace(&quot;/INGDirect.html?command=displayClientAccountSummary&amp;fill=1&quot;);
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</code></pre></div>

	<p>Let&#8217;s try to <span class="caps">GET</span> this page then.  Woohoo, we&#8217;re finally at the account overview page.  Wow that was hard work, so, so much harder than it should be for a web application.</p>


	<p>The final step is to <span class="caps">GET</span> and save the transaction page.  The url to the account page in the browser is:</p>


	<p>https://secure.ingdirect.co.uk/INGDirect.html?command=accountSummary&#38;method=fetchClientAccountSummary&#38;account=0&#38;stepName=saving</p>


	<p>GETting that url on the command line yields yet another javascript redirect (really, you do surprise me).</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">&lt;SCRIPT&gt;
location.replace(&quot;/INGDirect.html?command=displayAccountDetails&quot;);
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</code></pre></div>

	<p>Fine, let&#8217;s <span class="caps">GET</span> that url then (starting to get bored now).  And, wait for it&#8230;  Yeah, we have downloaded transactions.  Phew.  Right then, just a little code tidying and I&#8217;ll get it uploaded to google code and this article can be posted.  Yay.</p>


	<p>Ok, so we&#8217;re uploaded to <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ing-direct">google code</a>.  Now to set this little fella free&#8230;  An we&#8217;re done.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;ve updated my <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/12/24/curl-is-fast-becoming-my-favourite-toy">previous</a> curl/ruby script to automatically download my most recent transactions from Hsbc.  I created the original script as I had a couple of hours spare and wanted to see if I could do it.  The update has been driven by my continued use of <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">wesabe</a>.  Not only does it make my life a bit easier (which is, after all, the point of software) but the wesabe guys have suggested that they may be able to roll it into their client.  Cool.</p>


	<p>As an aside.  It really, really, really shouldn&#8217;t be as hard as it is to automatically get a downloaded list of my transactions.  At least Hsbc offer transactions in <a href="http://www.ofx.net">ofx</a> format, unlike <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/04/01/converting-egg-credit-card-statements-to-ofx-for-upload-to-wesabe">egg</a> and <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg-ofx/ing_direct">ing direct</a>.  Come on, The Banks, sort it out eh.</p>

<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">svn checkout http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg-ofx</code></pre></div>

	<p>As well as requiring <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/">hpricot</a>, you will need to edit the StatementsFolder and OfxOutputFolder variables in egg.rb.  These need to point to a directory containing html statements, and an empty output directory respectively.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve used the script to upload my last 12 statements to <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">wesabe</a> and everything seems to work Ok. If you have any questions, just post a comment here.</p>
