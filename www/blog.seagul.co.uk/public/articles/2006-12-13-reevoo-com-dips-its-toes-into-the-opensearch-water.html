              <p>So.  What does that mean exactly?  Well, right at the moment, not a great deal.  It pretty much means that you can add the ability to search reevoo.com to the Firefox 2 and <span class="caps">IE7</span> browsers very easily.  Visiting <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">reevoo.com</a> with either of these browsers will highlight part of the &#8216;search box&#8217;.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">IE 7</span> changes the little arrow to a goldy, orangey, yellowy type colour to indicate the presence of an opensearch enabled search engine.</p>

	<p>While Firefox 2 opts for a blue surround and additionally chooses to add our logo.  Woot.</p>


	<h3>I appreciate that I can now easily search reevoo from anywhere but was it really worth a blog post?</h3>


	<p>Hmm, interesting question (that wasn&#8217;t an actual question, I just made it up).</p>


	<p>Actually, I think that <a href="http://www.opensearch.org">opensearch</a> is pretty cool.  At the moment, we are just exposing our search results in their html form.  Just imagine, for a second, that we were instead, exposing our results as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">atom</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29">rss</a> feeds.  Now, also imagine<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> that retailers felt like being a little more open; and, as such, were offering an opensearch description of their search capabilities, along with search results in atom or rss feeds.  All we&#8217;d need then was an <a href="http://a9.com">aggregator</a> that would allow us to search for products across our chosen retailers and reevoo in one go.  The result would be a page containing both product reviews and pricing and stock availability from each retailer.  That, I think, would be pretty damn cool.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Currently, this requires a lot of imagination.  A quick browse this afternoon found four big retailers that don&#8217;t even have working search without javascript enabled.  At least they&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">well</a> <a href="http://wiki.welldesignedurls.org/Main_Page">designed</a> urls.  Oh, hang on&#8230;</p>
