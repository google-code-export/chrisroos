              <p>I was taking a look at the <a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/the_best_web_20_software_of_2005.htm">best web 2.0 software</a> when I came across a to do list alternative to <a href="http://www.tadalist.com">tada</a> called <a href="http://voo2do.com/">voo2do</a>.</p>


	<p>I just signed up to take a look, but unfortunately wasn&#8217;t amazingly impressed.  Fortunately it is easy to <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/26/it-should-be-easy-to-cancel-online-accounts">cancel your account</a>.</p>


	<p>It is obviously subjective but the interface to voo2do isn&#8217;t amazing, although there is some great use of Ajax to let you tab between input fields when entering tasks.  I also found it too complicated for my simple mind.  I guess I think a to do list should literally be a list of one line items that need to be done at some/any point in time (which is exactly what tada offers, nothing more and nothing less).  I think that once you need something more than that, it probably doesn&#8217;t live on a todo list but in something slightly more structured.</p>


	<p>I certainly think there are improvements that could be made to tada (some of which can be overcome with the use of <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">greasemonkey</a> and this <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/754">tada user script</a>) but for now it&#8217;s going to be what I stick with.</p>
