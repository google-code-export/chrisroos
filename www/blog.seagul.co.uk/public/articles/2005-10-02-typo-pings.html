              <p>I updated Typo last night to run from svn trunk, just to get the added benefit of pinging sites like <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs</a> and <a href="http://www.technorati.com">technorati</a> whenever I publish an article.  All was running smoothly until I just tried to create the newsreader article.  On saving, I get a not very helpful Rails app error.  The logs didn&#8217;t help an amazing amount either&#8230;</p>


	<p>It was at around this point that I remembered that my shared hosting account didn&#8217;t actually allow for certain low level network access (e.g. <acronym title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</acronym>) from my virtual machine.  Sure enough, disabling the auto-ping option made the error go away.  Having looked a bit further it would appear that the articles were actually being saved but I was seeing the error when the ping request was timing out.  This has already been reported on <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/ticket/400">typo trac</a>.  I must admit I don&#8217;t know the exact cause of the problem here but am guessing that the blog ping&#8217;s require access to some network operation that I don&#8217;t have permissions for&#8230;</p>

	<p>Mmmm, seems I was being stupid in my assumption.  The &#8216;blog pings&#8217; just transfer data over http, nothing lower than that.  As such, the problem must have been caused by a non-respondent ping server at the time I was trying to save.  In fact, I just created a new test article and enabled the pings and all worked fine.  Oops.</p>
