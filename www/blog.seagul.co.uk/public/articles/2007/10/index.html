                <p>Are Tesco Entertainment the new <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/03/16/orange-orange-orange">Orange</a>?  They might just be you know.  See, I&#8217;ve been sad and pathetic enough to <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions">record</a> details of unwanted emails that I receive.  So far <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment">Tesco Entertainment</a>, bless &#8216;em, have been unable to remove me from their mailing list for 90 days.  I thought I&#8217;d write them a little email to, you know, ask them to stop spamming me.</p>


<blockquote>
Here&#8217;s a list of emails you&#8217;ve sent me.

	<ul>
	<li>Received: 26-Jun-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 11-Jul-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 27-Jul-2007</li>
		<li><strong>Unsubscribed</strong>: 30-Jul-2007 (although it appeared that I wasn’t actually signed up to any offers…)</li>
		<li>Received: 08-Aug-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 21-Aug-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 16-Oct-2007</li>
		<li>I emailed you on 17th Oct:
“I unsubscribed from you guys on the 30th July 2007 (interestingly, my preferences suggested that I wasn’t actually subscribed to any mailings in the first place). Since then, you’ve sent me Tesco Entertainment emails on the 8th Aug, 21st Aug and 16th Oct1. Please stop.  Cheers,  Chris  [1] http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment”</li>
		<li>Received: 30-Oct-2007</li>
	</ul>


	<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I&#8217;ve received four emails since unsubscribing on the 30th July.  I think three months is long enough to remove someone from your spam list isn&#8217;t it?  Oh, and you&#8217;ll also see I&#8217;ve emailed you in the past too.  It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to reply would it?</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>


Chris

	<p><strong>Update Thu 15th Nov 2007</strong></p>


	<p>I received a reply from Tesco.</p>

                <p>We&#8217;ve been looking at embedding a little bit of javascript in one of our partner&#8217;s receipt pages to send us the details of which products were purchased (using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_Keeping_Unit">SKUs</a>).  A quick glance over the page revealed that nine other providers (<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">GA</a>, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization"><span class="caps">SEO</span></a> helper and a bunch of price comparators) had the same idea.  That&#8217;s the same data repeated nine times.  Ten if you include the human readable copy.  Now that seems like a problem waiting to be solved to me.  It also feels like a perfect fit for <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a>.  If we had a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/receipt">receipt microformat</a> then we could use javascript to parse the data rather than having to re-define it each time.  We would also be removing all duplication and creating semantically rich content (I guess that&#8217;s basically what microformats do anyway) in the process.</p>


	<p>So, something that might currently look like this:</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_html">&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Order Number&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;£19.99&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
  var order_id = 1
  var price = 1999
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;http://MY-PRICE-COMPARATOR&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
  var orderNumber = 1
  var price = 19.99
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;http://MY-SEO-HELPER&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- And repeat... --&gt;</code></pre></div>

	<p>Could become much simpler:</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_html">&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Order Number&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;orderNumber&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;orderPrice&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;orderCurrency&quot;&gt;£&lt;/span&gt;19.99&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://MY-PRICE-COMPARATOR&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;http://MY-SEO-HELPER&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre></div>

	<p>There has been discussion of such a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/receipt">receipt microformat</a> but a quick search seemed to suggest that it hasn&#8217;t been discussed in the context of this specific problem.  Maybe I&#8217;ll go add my voice to that discussion&#8230;</p>

                <p>This will be of interest to very few (if any) people &#8211; I&#8217;d suggest you just move on to something more interesting.</p>


	<p>Yesterday, I contacted Hsbc using the Internet Banking feedback form that was outside of the Internet Banking site itself.</p>


<blockquote>
I believe that the Ofx export of transactions has been broken since your internet banking &#8216;upgrade&#8217;.  I&#8217;ve tried many times to contact you using My Messages and also over the phone &#8211; the people I seem to be dealing with are unable or unwilling to help.

	<p>It&#8217;s a very minor problem &#8211; my account is overdrawn yet the balance is shown as positive in the Ofx export.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve posted about the issue on my blog<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, in the hope that someone might provide me some contact details of someone that can actually help.  Unfortunately that didn&#8217;t get my anywhere.</p>


	<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>

	<p>I was hoping to get through to a human.  Unfortunately I just got the same copy and paste bot that I get from within the Internet banking site.</p>

Dear Mr Roos

	<p>Thank you for using the feedback facility for our Internet Banking service.</p>


	<p>This is with regard to your recent e-mail concerning problems related to the download of transactions. From our experience to date, we have found that similar queries have been most effectively dealt with over the telephone rather than an exchange of a series of e-mails.</p>


	<p>On occasions it can be of benefit to be online whilst talking to us. You may wish to call from a separate line to your Internet connection.</p>


	<p>If you require further assistance, please call us on 0845 600 2290 (within UK) or +44 1226261226 (outside UK).  Minicom support is available on 0845 7125563.  The Internet Banking Helpdesk is open from Monday to Sunday 8.00am to 10.00pm (UK times).</p>

	<p>Tonight, I&#8217;ve emailed their complaints email address.</p>


<blockquote>
Hi,

	<p>I&#8217;ll apologise in advance for potentially mis-using your complaints email address.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve got a problem with downloading my transactions in Ofx format from the Internet banking site.  I&#8217;ve written up my experience so far<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  As a web developer with experience of the Ofx format I&#8217;m fairly sure that you&#8217;ve got a bug in your Internet banking site.  I&#8217;ve been trying for over a month to speak to someone in your support department to no avail.</p>


	<p>All I want is for you (or someone that is able to do more than hit copy, paste, send) to read the post below and pass this information on to your development team &#8211; they will be able to help.</p>


	<p>Be assured that I&#8217;m really just trying to help you guys.  If you need anything else from me then just give me a shout.</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>


	<p>Chris</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m getting slightly concerned that I might be wrong now &#8211; then I&#8217;d look real stoopid.  As it is I just look a bit sad.</p>

                <p>I&#8217;m almost 100% certain that there&#8217;s a <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/247143372">bug</a> in the Hsbc Internet Banking site.</p>


	<p>My account is overdrawn yet the balance shows as positive when I download my transactions in either &#8216;Money 98 onwards (ofx)&#8217; or &#8216;Quicken 2002 (ofx)&#8217;.  I believe that section 3.2.9.2 of the <a href="http://www.ofx.net">Ofx</a> 2.1.1 spec explains that these balances should be shown as negative.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve tried to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=31365693@N00&#38;q=hsbc+AND+ofx&#38;m=tags">email</a> and I&#8217;ve <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279942352">tried</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/279956472">to</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313632312">call</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/313656682">hsbc</a>.  Both to no avail.</p>


	<p>Does anyone know anyone that works at Hsbc and might be able to get a message to someone in development?  If not, what&#8217;s the etiquette on facebook groups?  I notice that there a few hsbc groups &#8211; can I just post messages to them asking for help?</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve gotten so used to dealing with <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">real</a> companies that I&#8217;d forgotten how the old world works.</p>

                <p>I haven&#8217;t done any research on this so it may have already been proposed over at the <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a> site.</p>


	<h3>The problem</h3>


	<p>Sometimes I want to communicate with the author of a webpage.  I don&#8217;t want to have to hunt around to find contact details and I probably don&#8217;t want to fill in a form.</p>


	<h3>A proposal to fix part of the problem</h3>


	<p>If the author&#8217;s contact details were semantically marked up, either on the page I was looking at or linked to elsewhere on the web, then I could use a simple parser to extract those details and select the best communication tool to use manually.</p>


	<p>Maybe some code can help explain what I mean.</p>


	<h4>A semantically marked up contact page.</h4>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&gt;

&lt;html&gt;

  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Contact Details&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;dl class=&quot;contactDetails&quot;&gt;
      &lt;dt&gt;Skype&lt;/dt&gt;
      &lt;dd class=&quot;skype identifier&quot;&gt;skype-username&lt;/dd&gt;
      &lt;dt&gt;MSN&lt;/dt&gt;
      &lt;dd class=&quot;msn identifier&quot;&gt;msn-username&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;/dl&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></div>

	<h3>Further considerations</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>If existing communication tools<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> were to integrate this parser then it would be easy to add a contact by giving the url of, for example, their blog.</li>
		<li>Author&#8217;s should be able to specify the order of the tools that they wish to use for communication.  We could just assume that the list of contact details is in the author&#8217;s preferred order.</li>
		<li>This would be open to spam.  Err, not too sure what to do about this.</li>
		<li>Ultimately, I&#8217;d like to hit a &#8216;communicate&#8217; button in <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">firefox</a> that automatically decides which communication protocols we have in common and allows me to get my message through.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Anyone have any thoughts?</p>


	<p>Code is all over on <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/contact-microformat/">google code</a>.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I&#8217;m thinking of multi protocol tools, like <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">adium</a>, in particular.</p>

                <p>So this is very much proof of concept and definitely not very useful in its current form&#8230;</p>


	<p>You need to execute this javascript in the context of a webpage.  In <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">firebug</a> (for example), paste it into the console and run.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_javascript">// Execute this within an existing webpage, using, for example, firebug console
function includeDelicious() {
  function loadScript(scriptUrl) {
    var scriptTag = document.createElement('script');
    scriptTag.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');
    scriptTag.src = scriptUrl;
    document.body.appendChild(scriptTag);
  }
  loadScript('http://s3.amazonaws.com/seagul/delicious.js');
}
if (typeof(getRelatedPosts) != 'function') { includeDelicious(); }</code></pre></div>

	<p>The javascript above loads this <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/seagul/delicious.js">script</a> that in turn loads <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/seagul/md5.js">md5.js</a>,  <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/seagul/jquery.js">jquery.js</a>, does some magic with the <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> <a href="http://www.json.org">json</a> <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/json/">feeds</a> before finally writing some &#8216;similar&#8217; sites to the bottom of the page you&#8217;re currently looking.  At the moment it finds the three most recent sites you&#8217;ve bookmarked for each of the tags that people have used when bookmarking the site you&#8217;re looking at.  It writes all this to the bottom of the current page, as this <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/1474875125/">screenshot</a> shows.</p>


	<p>Lots of things to do before this could possibly be deemed useful but I think it&#8217;s got some potential.</p>
