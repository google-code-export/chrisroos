              <p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> to record items on <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk">ebay</a> that I&#8217;m interested in.  The problem is that each ebay page can have multiple URLs &#8211; none of which redirect to the canonical version.  I can end up tagging the same listing twice if I happen to visit it with two different URLs &#8211; this is annoying.  It wouldn&#8217;t be hard for them to either redirect to the canonical version or just add a <code>&lt;link rel="bookmark" ... /&gt;</code> tag to the document.  This way, I could ensure that I was always bookmarking the same version (even modifying the del.icio.us plugin if necessary).</p>


	<p>This isn&#8217;t just a problem for ebay: lots of sites duplicate their content on multiple URLs (hello retailers).  Maybe in the short term we could come up with some rules for turning any given <span class="caps">URL</span> on a specific site into its canonical representation.  That sounds like a nice, useful, little service to me.  Can someone build it for me please?</p>

                    <p>With ebay&#8230; I think you are better off just giving up&#8230; unless you bookmarked the auction ID and stripped of the other parameters.  Each auction has a unique number that can be tracked.  You seem to have a grasp of JavaScript so maybe you could build a linklet?</p>

                    <p>Hey Matt,</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve started to wonder whether a greasemonkey script might do what I need.  The script would just recognise the page you&#8217;re on and look up, in a set of rules, how to find the canonical <span class="caps">URL</span>.  Sadly, I&#8217;m not sure when I might find time to do it.</p>
