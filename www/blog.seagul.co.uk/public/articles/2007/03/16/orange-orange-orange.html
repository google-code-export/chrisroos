              <p>Tuttety tut tut tut.  I unsubscribed from you guys, don&#8217;t you <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/01/12/move-over-seetickets-com-youve-got-nothing-on-orange-co-uk">remember</a>?  Obviously not, as you&#8217;ve just emailed me again.  Oh well, might as well hit that unsubscribe link one more time&#8230;</p>

                    <p>Watchdog just slagged off Orange broadband, one of the major complaints was the difficulty in unsubscribing; sound familiar?
