            </p>
          
            <p>I needed to pay some money to <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk"><span class="caps">HMRC</span></a> to cover my tax.  <span class="caps">HMRC</span> kindly supply me with their sort code and account number so that I could transfer the money directly from my bank account.  Logged into <a href="http://www.hsbc.co.uk">Hsbc</a>, I entered the relevant details and tried to make the payment.  Instead of going through like a good payment should, I was presented with this useless error message.</p>

	<p>&#8220;We are unable to deal with your request. Please call us on 0845 600 2290 quoting reference 841, and we will be happy to help.  Select an option from the left-hand menu to continue.&#8221;</p>


	<p>I happen to know that, in English, this means, &#8220;You have tried to make a payment to a known bank account using the Friends and Family option.  You&#8217;re a dumbass.  It&#8217;s obvious that instead of blindly typing in the sort code and account number, you should select from this helpful list of accounts that we already know about.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Hmm, now if only I knew which of 12 cryptic names to choose I&#8217;d be away&#8230;  Anyway.  A short phone call later, filled with such insights as &#8220;lots of people seem to phone up about this&#8221;, and, &#8220;we can&#8217;t give out the list of names vs sort codes as it&#8217;s against data protection&#8221;, I was all set.  For anyone that cares, the sort code and account number I had (10-50-41 and 23456000) match to the incredibly obvious &#8216;HMRC <span class="caps">CORP TAX SHIP</span>&#8217;.  Actually, I&#8217;ve just come across a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/howtopay/bank-account-checker.htm">page</a> detailing all the different <span class="caps">HMRC</span> accounts and what they&#8217;re for.  A quick scan suggests that you can probably derive the cryptic Hsbc name from the more human friendly name on that page.</p>


	<p>If anyone happens to come across this page while searching for the error above, maybe you could leave details in the comments of the sort code, account number and Hsbc cryptic name, in order to help out any future visitors.</p>
