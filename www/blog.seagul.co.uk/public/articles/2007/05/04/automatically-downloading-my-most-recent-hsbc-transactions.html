              </p>
          
              <p>I&#8217;ve updated my <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/12/24/curl-is-fast-becoming-my-favourite-toy">previous</a> curl/ruby script to automatically download my most recent transactions from Hsbc.  I created the original script as I had a couple of hours spare and wanted to see if I could do it.  The update has been driven by my continued use of <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">wesabe</a>.  Not only does it make my life a bit easier (which is, after all, the point of software) but the wesabe guys have suggested that they may be able to roll it into their client.  Cool.</p>


	<p>As an aside.  It really, really, really shouldn&#8217;t be as hard as it is to automatically get a downloaded list of my transactions.  At least Hsbc offer transactions in <a href="http://www.ofx.net">ofx</a> format, unlike <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/04/01/converting-egg-credit-card-statements-to-ofx-for-upload-to-wesabe">egg</a> and <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/egg-ofx/ing_direct">ing direct</a>.  Come on, The Banks, sort it out eh.</p>

                    <p>Thanks for the script, has been working well up until a few days ago when <span class="caps">HSBC</span> changed their website.  Any chance of updating the script?  Thanks.</p>

	<p>The script still works fine for me.  What problems are you experiencing?</p>

                    <p>I guess they haven&#8217;t done this to all their customers, but they have changed their online banking to look more like their main site&#8230;and in the process have changed URLs, <span class="caps">HTML</span> coding etc. which of course breaks the script.  This is the actual error I get:</p>


	<p>hsbc.rb:30: undefined method `downcase&#8217; for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)</p>


	<p>presumably because the regex to extract the security code indices doesn&#8217;t match any more. Since I have access to the new online banking I&#8217;ll see if I can add support for it to the script.</p>

                    <p>Here is a new version of the script which is compatible with the new version of the site.  It should also stay compatible with the old version&#8212;since I don&#8217;t have an account which is on the old version I cannot test this.
