                <p>On the face of it, I rather like it. I can&#8217;t compare it to the old version because, I&#8217;m afraid, I never saw it.</p>


	<p>Specific bits (well, you did say!):</p>


	<p>I really like the map and the location of the geolocated-comment-speech-bubble thingies. Debbie from Whitstable looked like she was commenting from Dartford though, certainly the bubble was not emanating from anywhere near Thanet. (Of course, only a nit-picking local would notice)</p>


	<p>I liked watching the review quotes flash up &#8211; I can imagine people just staying around to watch them. I really hated the spelling errors in the quotes, though. But I pick those nits too.</p>


	<p>I went for a look at some reviews for a specific product (the &#8220;Canon 4000 <span class="caps">SLR</span>&#8221;, which would more correctly be described by its real name, &#8220;Canon <span class="caps">EOS 400D</span>&#8221; &#8211; quality control?) and I&#8217;m baffled how it can score 9/10 yet be &#8220;average&#8221; in every respect. Ah, I went to &#8220;what does this mean&#8221; and I understand it now. Maybe it could be clearer on the page?</p>


Look and feel seems pretty intuitive, which is nice. Here&#8217;s a funny little thing though &#8211; when I wanted to switch back to the site to look at something, I had a moment of trouble finding the tab in Firefox. I realised that there were two contributing factors: 
	<ul>
	<li>first, I was on the <span class="caps">FAQ</span>, so the tab caption was &#8220;Frequently Ask&#8230;&#8221; </li>
		<li>second, the icon was the blue-quotes thingy</li>
	</ul>


	<p>On the favicon idea, I was looking for something orange, which suggests that I immediately assigned mentally the white &#8220;revoo&#8221; on an orange background as the logo &#8211; I think I might have spotted a white &#8220;r&#8221; in an orange circle more easily.</p>


	<p>But I&#8217;m a nit-picky geek<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> with time in his hands while I wait for my database server to stop being broken.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> How much of a geek? I just noticed that this box takes Textile, so I had to go back and add a pretty unnecessary list, just because I could. Oh, and a footnote.</p>

                <p>I like it!  Although the constantly updating map quickly became distracting as I looked at the rest of the home page.  Perhaps it could stop after a few reviews with a link over the map saying &#8220;see more&#8221; or you could add a button to stop it&#8230;</p>

                <p>Hey Doug,</p>


	<p>Thanks for the feedback.  I&#8217;ve personally not found the map distracting &#8211; but then I&#8217;m not often on the homepage so my views probably shouldn&#8217;t count :-).  One oversight, in my view, is that it currently takes at least two clicks to get from the homepage to any reviews.  In fact, I might try to sort that today.</p>


	<p>Cheers.</p>

                <p>One very quick initial comment is that on the homepage the reviews that pop-up need to have a link to the associated product page. The actual product review pages are clearer now, I had to laugh at one reviewer&#8217;s negative points regarding the Canon <span class="caps">EOS 400D</span>&#8230;</p>


	<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s not possible to crop pictures on the lcd and then to save them. Quite a drawback if you don&#8217;t have the time to fiddle around on the computer.&#8221;</em></p>

                <p>One more point; using light-blue text on the site makes it hard to distinguish where there are hyper-links (darker-blue text). This is especially noticeable on the <span class="caps">FAQ</span> page.</p>

                <p>Hey Ben,</p>


	<p>I completely agree that the reviews need to link through to the product review pages.  Although it&#8217;s very unlikely to be of a product you&#8217;re interested in, it would allow people to get a feel for the product pages immediately.</p>


	<p>As for the links, I see your point too.  The grey visited-link colour isn&#8217;t particular clear either.  Some work to do there I think.</p>


	<p>Cheers</p>
