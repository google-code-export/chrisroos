              <p>I <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/05/17/pesky-scammers">wrote</a> a short while ago about receiving comments that were not obviously spam.  In the few weeks  between that post and this, I&#8217;ve received several more legitimate looking comments.  Tonight, I finally looked in some detail at the comments I&#8217;d received.  The comments were either very generic (&#8216;nice post&#8217; or &#8216;thanks for the info&#8217;) or were copied from previous comments on the site.  The &#8216;homepages&#8217; came in four different flavours.</p>


	<h3>Look like legitimate blogs but contain hidden content and porn links at the bottom of the page.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>moradblog.com</li>
		<li>fromgreghead.com</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Crappy web shops.  These only really caught my attention because they all look identical.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>camikon.com</li>
		<li>leaderdvd.com</li>
		<li>pet-supplies-store.info</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Look like legitimate blogs but are noticeable due to a complete lack of style and porn links at the bottom of the page.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>pinkyspaperhause.com</li>
		<li>timesofsooz.com</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Look like legitimate websites but a <code>site:&lt;website&gt;</code> search in google reveals lots of porn pages.</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>smachex.info</li>
		<li>wampy.info</li>
		<li>www.valmux.com</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Oh, there is also one other site that I really cannot decide whether to classify as spam or not &#8211; ireadnews.net (sorry if you&#8217;re not spam).</p>


	<p>The addresses are here (and not linked to) for the benefit of anyone that happens to stumble across this page.  I&#8217;m actually quite amazed at the depth of some of these sites.  moradblog.com in particular has links to lots of &#8216;web 2.0&#8217; sites for &#8216;morad&#8217; (flickr, del.icio.us etc).  It makes me half wonder if they are actual spam sites or whether the site has been hijacked in some way..</p>

                      I&#8217;ve received another innocent looking comment, &#8220;Hey man, thanks for article!&#8221;, this time from gribitonline.com. I followed the same procedure as last time and found that this site contains the same style porn links at the bottom...
