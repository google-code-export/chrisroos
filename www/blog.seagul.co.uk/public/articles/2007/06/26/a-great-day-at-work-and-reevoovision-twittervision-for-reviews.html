              <p>A few of days ago I <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisroos/statuses/114202552">came across</a> <a href="http://twittervision.com/">twittervision</a>.  Just ten hours later I had checked some code into <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">our</a> repository that allows us to do the same thing (as twittervision) but for our reviews.  Yup, it was a very good day indeed.  Although the initial code was complete within a few hours, it needed a bit of polishing (kudos to <a href="http://po-ru.com">Paul</a>) which meant that we only got it deployed yesterday.  I guess one working day between proof of concept and deployment isn&#8217;t that bad&#8230;  Anyway, go check it out &#8211; <a href="http://www.reevoo.com/vision.html">reevoovision</a>.</p>


	<h3>The days events</h3>


	<p>I started the morning by creating an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml">xml</a> feed of the ten most recently published reviews.  On filling a review, the reviewer is asked to enter their town, which needed to be converted to latitude/longitude to allow us to plot a point on the map.  Luckily, a little googling revealed the <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">geonames</a> web service that did exactly what I wanted.  So, using a combination of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">ruby</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">rails</a>, <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>, <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/">hpricot</a> and <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">mongrel</a> I had a simple web server that downloaded and parsed the reviews, converted place name to lat/long, and plotted the results on a google map (with help from the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/fridays.html">fridays</a> <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/sdgmapi2/index.html">google map book</a>).  A good proof of concept but not quite right.</p>


	<p>I was reminded that we collect the purchaser&#8217;s postcode from our retailers.  This, in combination with a <a href="http://www.easypeasy.com/guides/article.php?article=64">free list</a> of UK <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_postcodes">outcodes</a> (the first bit of the postcode) against latitude/longitude, allowed for much greater accuracy (well, to within about 2km) in plotting the location of the reviewer.</p>


	<p>The next step was to polish up the rough demo.  Instead of the previous server side hackery, I used the excellent <a href="http://jquery.com">jquery</a> javascript library to perform an &#8220;Ajax&#8221; request of the reviews and parse the xml to build a simple hash of the required data.  Using the twittervision source as reference, I got a &#8216;proper&#8217; (i.e. reviews popping up in sequence) demo running.</p>


	<p>From here, it was a basic case of tidying up some rough edges.  Instead of returning the reviews data as xml, I converted it to <a href="http://json.org/">json</a> to make for trivial parsing in javascript.  I also added the jquery <a href="http://jquery.com/plugins/project/dimensions">dimensions</a> plugin to resize the containing div, and in turn the map, to the size of the page.  The final touch was attempting to keep the UK centered in the window.</p>


	<p>Reevoovision currently selects and displays published reviews at random to provide a constantly updating map, although maybe it&#8217;d be cool to get it to display submitted/published reviews in real-time.</p>


	<p>I can&#8217;t get over how addictive it is to watch the reviews pop-up all over the country, it really emphasises the fact that these are actually real people writing about their experiences.  Hmm, that sounds a bit sales &#38; marketing.  I do mean it though, honest.</p>

                    <p>Well done mate, that&#8217;s really good. It&#8217;s great when one has an idea and is able to get on it and have it done within a day.</p>


	<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

                    <p>I&#8217;ve actually just added a <a href="http://prestonhellings.co.uk/e107_plugins/wrap/wrap.php?5">google maps feature to my Preston FC site</a>.</p>


	<p>Not as complicated as yours though&#8230;</p>
