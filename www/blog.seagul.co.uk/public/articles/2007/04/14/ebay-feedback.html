            <p>This is a pathetic moan about something that is really not important at all.</p>


	<p>I bought an <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#38;ih=014&#38;sspagename=STRK%3AMEWN%3AIT&#38;viewitem=&#38;item=330105019114&#38;rd=1&#38;rd=1">Apple mini <span class="caps">DVI</span> to <span class="caps">VGA</span> adapter</a> from someone on <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk">ebay</a>.  For various reasons, I was unable to test the adapter until yesterday (Fri 13th Apr), two weeks after the purchase.  That didn&#8217;t stop the seller emailing me a week ago, suggesting that I leave feedback before they do.  That&#8217;s pathetic &#8211; feedback should be left for me based on the speed of my purchase alone, which was immediate.  What the seller is actually saying in that email is that if I decide to leave them bad feedback then they&#8217;ll probably do the same to me out of retaliation.  Grow up eh.</p>


	<p>The adapter actually works great, and I&#8217;ve now left the seller positive feedback.</p>

                <p>What&#8217;s the point in feedback then? The feedback should be completely independant of each other.</p>


	<p>He should&#8217;ve left feedback as soon as he received your payment. That is as much input he needs from you.</p>


	<p>If he did get a negative comment from you then there is a chance for him to put his case forward, not to retaliate with a negative comment.</p>

                <p>Because feedback is so important to E-bay users (both selling and buying), they want to make sure if anyone has had any bad experience that they can put in their oar&#8230;</p>


	<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I was 3 weeks late with that delivery and the guy complained, but he didn&#8217;t give me his address for 2 weeks and he was an asshole!&#8221;</p>


	<p>I always feel a little bit put out of they don&#8217;t leave feedback for me, but not enough to contact them or withhold my own feedback!</p>

                <p>Isn&#8217;t the solution for eBay to allow multiple feedback for a single transaction? For example, if a sale goes through smoothly, but the product falls apart a week later because it&#8217;s shoddy, I can&#8217;t leave feedback if I&#8217;ve already said that the transaction was satisfactory.</p>


	<p>As the system currently is, feedback is a scarce commodity that ends up being traded quid pro quo &#8211; but that scarcity is entirely artificial. And I still don&#8217;t know whether the stuff people are selling is any good &#8211; just that they are good at selling it.</p>
