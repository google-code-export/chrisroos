            </p>
          
            <p>Ok, so that second bit isn&#8217;t strictly true ;-)  I was, however, flattered to be contacted by Debbie from <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">Wesabe</a> to answer a few questions and maybe provide a quote for their press release.  They have just improved their service by <a href="http://blog.wesabe.com/index.php/2007/07/12/your-bank-has-a-rest-api-now-shhh-dont-tell-them/">offering</a> an <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/API"><span class="caps">API</span></a> after all.</p>


	<p>They asked, and I answered by rambling quite a bit.  In the preview of the press release I&#8217;ve seen, my ramblings have been summarized in three words :-)  Hey, I&#8217;m just honoured they asked.  I also asked if I could post their questions and my reply here, so, in all its glory, here it be.</p>


	<p><strong>Debbie Pfeifer</strong></p>


	<p>Hey, Chris.</p>


	<p>I work with Marc Hedlund at Wesabe.  I know he gave you a heads up that we&#8217;re working on releasing an <span class="caps">API</span>.  We&#8217;re getting close &#8211; we plan to get it out either late this week or early next week &#8211; and I was writing to ask for a favor.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m putting together a press release announcing the <span class="caps">API</span> and we thought it would be cool to get a quote from a developer who has done some hacks.  If you&#8217;d rather not participate, no worries whatsoever.  If you&#8217;d be willing, following is a quick list of questions:</p>


	<p><strong>Chris Roos</strong></p>


	<p>Cool, I appreciate being considered.</p>


	<p><strong>Debbie Pfeifer</strong></p>


	<p>Why do you use Wesabe?</p>


	<p><strong>Chris Roos</strong></p>


	<p>Because it&#8217;s a great application :-)   No, seriously it&#8217;s because tagging makes sense to me.  It makes sense that, if I buy an apple, I should be able to categorise it as an apple, fruit, lunch, food, groceries and others that I can&#8217;t think of right now.  It&#8217;s a bit looser than traditional finance applications which I find perfect.  I must admit that I don&#8217;t currently use the social side of wesabe, helping others out with tips and advice, but that in no way detracts from the usefulness of the service to me.  I also love the fact that I&#8217;m able to interact with you guys, it means a lot to know that you&#8217;re listening.</p>


	<p><strong>Debbie Pfeifer</strong></p>


	<p>From your blog, I saw the projects you&#8217;ve already done (automating downloads).  Are there other things you&#8217;d like to do with Wesabe once you have the <span class="caps">API</span>?</p>


	<p><strong>Chris Roos</strong></p>


	<p>Hmm, let&#8217;s see.  I&#8217;m a big fan of the command line.  I&#8217;ve already been thinking about tidying up some of the previous work I&#8217;ve done so that it effectively provides a command line interface to my banking websites.  I can see that a command line interface to Wesabe might be quite appealing to me too.  I&#8217;m just wondering about some potential mapping mashups too.  I try to tag my transactions with the place they were purchased. Assuming I tagged every purchase with at least a town or city it&#8217;d be cool to see the distribution geographically.  Actually, I have a feeling I could do this with what&#8217;s available right now so maybe scrap that thought.</p>


	<p><strong>Debbie Pfeifer</strong></p>


	<p>Anything else you&#8217;d like to add?</p>


	<p><strong>Chris Roos</strong></p>


	<p>I originally had this bit under the question of why I like Wesabe, but felt it best here.  To be fair, it probably doesn&#8217;t matter too much. Anyway, I like the fact that Wesabe is developing the software that my greedy, super-rich banks should be developing ;-)   I love the fact that you are, in a small way, changing the world.  Sticking two fingers up at traditional finance applications and banking web apps themselves, because, I assume, you know that you&#8217;re doing it right.</p>


	<p>One other idea I&#8217;ve been thinking about is uploading my mobile phone statements to Wesabe.  I currently have access to a pdf representation of my itemised bill.  I&#8217;m thinking that if I can parse the pdf, or even just copy the content into a text file that I can parse, I could upload and use all the features of Wesabe to analyse my bills.  I think this&#8217;d be great as I&#8217;ve personally never come across a phone company that allows ready, easy access to itemised call data in a useful format.  I guess this is because they don&#8217;t want to make it to easy for us to work out that they&#8217;re screwing us over in some way (cynical huh?).  Anyway, just a thought and I&#8217;m obviously not sure how that&#8217;d sit with you guys&#8230;?</p>


	<p><strong>Debbie Pfeifer</strong></p>


	<p>Again, if you&#8217;d rather not do this, I totally understand.  If you&#8217;re game, could we use your name?  Also, how would you describe yourself&#8230; a (your job) from (city)?</p>


	<p><strong>Chris Roos</strong></p>


	<p>Feel free to use my name.  Although not really one for titles, I guess I&#8217;d be classed as a software developer working in London, but from Ramsgate.</p>


	<p><strong>Debbie Pfeifer</strong></p>


	<p>Thanks, Chris.  Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>


	<p><strong>Chris Roos</strong></p>


	<p>One quick question.  Am I able to publish this email to my blog?  If not, I&#8217;ll probably just published my answers to your questions, which I could paraphrase to offer context.</p>


	<p>Cheers, and hope there&#8217;s at least something useful in these ramblings.</p>


	<p>Chris</p>


	<p><strong>Debbie Pfeifer</strong></p>


	<p>Best,
Debbie Pfeifer
Wesabe</p>
