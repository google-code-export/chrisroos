              <p>I&#8217;ve spent some time today looking into getting <a href="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/">Cyrus Imap</a> installed on <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBsd</a> 5.3R.</p>


	<p>I haven&#8217;t got too far yet but think I&#8217;ve probably learned a few things I didn&#8217;t know.</p>


	<p>Initially I just installed cyrus-imap from the ports and left it with all the default values.  Once I had this and played around a bit, I un-installed and started re-installing the <a href="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/">cyrus-sasl</a> library manually, playing with various configuration options.</p>


	<p>When installed using the default options, all of the following &#8216;plugins&#8217; are installed in .</p>


	<ul>
	<li>liblogin</li>
		<li>libanonymous</li>
		<li>libcrammd5</li>
		<li>libdigestmd5</li>
		<li>libgssapiv2</li>
		<li>libntlm</li>
		<li>libotp</li>
		<li>libplain</li>
		<li>libsasldb</li>
	</ul>


	<p>My preference at this stage is to get the imap server running with plaintext passwords over a <span class="caps">TLS</span> encrypted pipe.  As such I started looking at the options available to <code>configure</code>.  Some of the options seem to be represented in the Makefile so my first approach was to &#8216;disable&#8217; them on the command line.</p>


<pre>
# make -DWITHOUT_OTP -DWITHOUT_CRAM -DWITHOUT_DIGEST -DWITHOUT_GSSAPI
</pre>

	<p>I also really wanted to disable anonymous access (which I could see how to do in the options in <code>configure</code> but not in the Makefile) but I ignored that for now.</p>


	<p>When installed, having been built with the above options, I had all of the above &#8216;plugins&#8217; except the following.</p>


	<ul>
	<li>libcrammd5</li>
		<li>libdigestmd5</li>
		<li>libgssapiv2</li>
		<li>libotp</li>
	</ul>


	<p>This was better but I still had some &#8216;plugins&#8217; that I didn&#8217;t really want.  Once again, I un-installed the sasl port and this time built it passing arguments directly to <code>configure</code>.</p>


<pre>
make CONFIGURE_ARGS+='--disable-cram --disable-digest --disable-otp --disable-gssapi --disable-anon'
</pre>

	<p>This time I ended up with just the libplain and libsasldb &#8216;plugins&#8217; which seems much closer to what I want &#8211; at least I think it does based on my very very limited knowledge at present.</p>
