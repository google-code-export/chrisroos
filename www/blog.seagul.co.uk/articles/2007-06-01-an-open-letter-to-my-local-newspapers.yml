  I just sent this email to the editors of four local papers.
  
  <blockquote>
  Hi,
  
  I'm emailing you as representatives of (what I believe to be) the four main newspapers in Thanet.
  
  * KM Extra
  * Thanet Adscene
  * Isle of Thanet Gazette
  * Thanet Times
  
  On the off chance you're already bored or have filed me to spam (please don't), a quick summary is that I'm offering to do some work, for free, that might help foster discussion around your newspaper content.
  
  I'd love it if all of your newspaper content was on-line.  I realise that both kentonline.co.uk and ickent.co.uk already exist and carry *some* of the content from your papers.  I also realise that it may not be commercially wise to publish all newspaper content on-line.
  
  So, I've come up with a very cunning (it's not that cunning) plan.  I'm thinking of creating a blog-type site, where each post will represent a newspaper story.  I propose that the title of the blog post will be the title of the article in the paper, and that the body of the blog post will be left blank.  My intention is that people that buy/receive any of the above papers can use the permalink of the blog post as a central discussion point.  They can either comment right there on the blog or they can ping/trackback to the post from their own blogs.  The best thing that could happen is that other people stumble across these conversations and want to get involved, at which point they have to go buy a copy of the paper to get the original content.
  
  I'm planning on doing this stuff anyway, but I wanted to give you guys a heads up.  I figure that this mail will either a) land in spamland, b) be received with a negative response, or c) be received with a positive response.  Oh, or d) received and ignored.  Pretty much covered all bases there haven't I?  Anyhoo, I'd love to hear any thoughts you have, especially if they are strongly for or against the idea.
  
  This letter will be posted to my blog[1] shortly.  On the off chance you've read this far and feel like replying, I'd like to post them to my blog too, but that's completely up to you.
  
  To summarize.
  
  * I'd like to converse with other people that have read the same article that I have.
  * The only content from your newspapers that will appear on-line is the heading of each article.
  * I'm offering to do all the work.
  * I'll host the site and transcribe each article from each of the four weekly papers.
  * The site won't have advertising.
  * Anyone can comment on the site.
  * Anyone can trackback/pingback to the site.
  * I can't promise that I'll keep up the work forever.
  * All the content of the site will be available to anyone that wants it - probably under a creative commons license or something similar.
  * I have no intention of making money from this.  In fact, I'm willing to pay money to make it happen.
  
  Cheers,
  
  Chris

  :body: Thanet has FOUR newspapers? Blimey. These days we get precisely, er, zero local papers delivered (in Sidcup) which puts me on the wrong side of the can't-be-bothered barrier.

    Any response yet?? Sadly I believe that it'll be filed under option d)received and ignored.
    
    I'd actually prefer if it had maybe the introductory paragraph to give at least an outline of the article but this obviously runs into some copyright issues etc.
    
    Good luck with this though, and you will be whole-heartedy welcomed on the <a href="http://www.thanetbloglist.co.uk">Thanet Blog List</a>

    Adem,
    
    Just had a look at the Thanet Times thing.  It's pretty cool that you got a response from the author of the article in the comments.  In fact, I'm hoping Kathy might still be around in order to promote this post.

    Just found <a href="http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/news/2007/07july/070706buy.shtml">this</a> out on the local blogger circuit.
    
    The Trinity group has been bought out and apparently the new owners run the Daily Mail too. I'm sure they'll add some 'class' to the local rags. I wonder how many Diana stories they'll get in there!
