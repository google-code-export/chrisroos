    Hi Chris,
    
    I'm Ed, one of the founders of Nestoria.
    
    Many thanks for the kind words, we like to think we're not crap either ;-).
    
    That being said, we know we still have a lot to do to make searching for property as simple as possible. Any ideas you (or your readers) have are very welcome. 
    
    In that sense, from your blog I see that you're a Ruby coder. I don't suppose I could persuade you to write a Ruby library for using the Nestoria API? We recently had someone create a python library:

    and we'd love to see what clever ideas the Ruby community could come up with for playing with our database.
    
    Thanks again for the vote of confidence,
    
    Ed
