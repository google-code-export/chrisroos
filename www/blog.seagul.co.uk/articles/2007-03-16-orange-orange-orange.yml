    Watchdog just slagged off Orange broadband, one of the major complaints was the difficulty in unsubscribing; sound familiar?

  Tuttety tut tut tut.  I unsubscribed from you guys, don't you "remember":http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/01/12/move-over-seetickets-com-youve-got-nothing-on-orange-co-uk?  Obviously not, as you've just emailed me again.  Oh well, might as well hit that unsubscribe link one more time...
