    Great stuff, can you come up with one for Halifax?! :-)
    
    I am worried about the long term viability of this sort of thing however, given that many UK banks are on track to introduce hardware dongles to perform authentication (in the hope of reducing the damage caused by phishing scams). However as I wrote <a href="http://www.thenewsbeforethenews.com/2006/03/27/where-is-the-web-service-api-for-my-bank-account/">here</a> it would be great if they would just offer me some sort of web service API; or at least email me my transactions in a machine-readable format every day/week.

    Hey James,
    
    I'd love to help with an implementation for the Halifax but I don't have an account with them I'm afraid.
    
    I agree about the long term viability of this approach.  It'd be great if just one of the banks understood this stuff and started offering secure rss/atom feeds of transactions.  Then, logging in would only be required when you wanted to do something important, like moving money between account and making payments.

  :body: So um, what exactly do we do with this (and/or how do we do it) to make LloydsTSB talk to Wesabe automagically?
:body: |-
  In my continuing quest to cut down my use of banking websites (and increase my use of "wesabe":http://www.wesabe.com), I've hacked together a script to download my recent transactions from "Lloyds Tsb":http://www.lloydstsb.com.  Sadly, the transactions are in "QIF":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QIF format, as only QIF and "CSV":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values formats are offered.  Maybe I'll get round to exporting the data in "OFX":http://www.ofx.net format sometime in the future.
