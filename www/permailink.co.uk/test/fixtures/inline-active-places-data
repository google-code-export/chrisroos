Hey Nick,

Thanks for getting back to me so soon, although I was disappointed with
the answer.

I was a little confused by some of the reasons you give for the data not
being available so thought it might help if I clarify exactly what I was
after.

For the public swimming pools only, I'd want an address and maybe office
telephone number.  This is for re-publication, not for me to contact
them separately (no need to worry about 'survey fatique').  Any
additional information like opening times and prices would be a bonus.
To clarify, I'm not after contacting individuals at the swimming pools,
or even the centres themselves (so I don't think Data Protection
applies).

Do you know if I could request the data under the Freedom of Information
act?[1]

Cheers,

Chris
