Chris,

Apologies for not getting back sooner - I spotted your mail this morning
whilst doing a trawl for unread mail.

This is where the world of railways gets complicated even for me - the
data we have isn't ours, we licence it from RSP like anyone else -
despite it being a sister company of the same parent (ATOC Ltd).

We are actively considering opening up our feeds for not-for-profits,
the problem is from my point of view is that if we are to do it at all,
we need to do it properly, e.g. create documentation, provide forums,
have the time to monitor those forums and also respond to developer
comments.  If we do it half cocked, I think it will create more problems
than it solves.  There is also the argument that you have alluded to, of
abstraction of revenue from our site.

Best wishes,

Alastair

Hi Alastair,

I was initially going to reply asking why you were so restrictive in=20
your terms and conditions but having done a little reading I notice that

you actually sell the timetable data[1]: I'm guessing that has a big=20
part to play in the decision.

Out of interest what are the target markets for this data?  Do Deutsche=20
Bahn buy the data from you?  Anyone else?

I wonder if you'd ever consider opening up your data for non-profit=20
services?  I can see that you'd argue against my SMS service as it could

potentially take revenue away from your own offering, but I had another=20
idea: I was planning to create a Google Subscribed Link[2] that would=20
allow me to search timetables right from the google search box.=20
Although harder to argue that this would negatively impact your revenue=20
I can still see that it could potentially deprive nationalrail.co.uk of=20
visitors and therefore potentially lower your advertising revenue.

Great work on the widgets you're creating btw: I only knew about the=20
google widget because of the footer on your email.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,

Chris
