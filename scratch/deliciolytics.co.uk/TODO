* Produce an atom feed of bookmarks, ordered by bookmark date (so that you get alerts when people bookmark your stuff).

* Make the sitemap downloader more robust, i.e. make it follow the same rules as actual spiders.

* Add navigation.

* Add a button in the interface for grabbing the sitemap.

* Don't add a button in the interface for grabbing all urlinfo/bookmarks (this needs to be offline i think).

* Only poll delicious once or twice a day per distinct feed.

* Respect rev=canonical to find out where else this resource used to live and grab history for them too.

* Add attr_accessible

* Show stats per user, number of users bookmarks per domain and number of users bookmarks across all domains, for example.

* Link to the individual url bookmarks from the domain bookmarks controller.

* Order the bookmarks in descending date order (i.e. newest first).
