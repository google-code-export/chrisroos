The setup_rails_project.rb script uses a git cloned copy of rails to test the mass assignment of activerecord timestamp attributes in rails apps built against various versions of rails.

It might be useful to extract the 'build a rails app against a specific version of rails' as a more generally useful tool.

See my post[1] for more information.
