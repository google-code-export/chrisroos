I guess this is just a bit of an investigation into exposing some of the 'hidden' data currently in delicious.com.

The idea is to allow someone to enter the URL of their sitemap (or even just their site as we can probably find their sitemap) and we would have something that went away and monitored activity against those URLs in delicious.  I like the idea of providing a RSS/Atom feed per URL, and also the idea of posting to a webhook when your site is bookmarked again.

This is just the very first step.  I've manually downloaded the history of my chrisroos.co.uk bookmarks and have inserted that into the database.

Things I'm currently thinking:

* Open to a few friends to begin with, to gauge interest.
* What happens if lots of people try to enter their sitemaps at the same time.
* A way for people to get back to their stats - maybe just re-enter their sitemap/home page url again?
** I don't think I need to worry about security as all this stuff is publicly available anyway.
* Could/should I store the data in Simple DB (or equivalent)?
* Delicious might get annoyed if I were to poll them too frequently.
