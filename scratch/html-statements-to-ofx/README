INTRO
-----
I've just rediscovered this code in an old 'scratch' directory I had laying about.  I think I was planning to re-implement my ofx magic in a more test-driven way.  The Lloyds tests look kinda OK so I'm going to pop this in my google code repos for now and maybe one day I'll revisit it.


TODO
----
* convert hsbc.html to hsbc.ofx
* convert paypal.html to paypal.ofx

NOTES
-----
* auto-login for ing-direct on wesabe doesn't work (doesn't even ask for memorable date)

HAND-ROLLED WORKING OFX UPLOADS
-------------------------------
* egg
* ing-direct
* lloyds-tsb
* smile
