* Think about whether I want to follow the rails approach (an app/script that generates my application directory) or a more vendorising type approach (where I try to fit it with existing extension directory structures).

* Add a task that generates the expected directory structure (including an example extension.yml).

* Generate a proper skeleton extension with this utility (including the src/chrome.manifest src/chrome/ folders etc)

* Improve the way in which I currently get the version number in the 'compiled' extension, particularly remove the requirement to duplication the version number in the extension config.
