              <p>I just read <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/2007/11/16/can-vrm-fix-drm/">this</a> article over on the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm/">Project <span class="caps">VRM</span></a> blog.  There was a fragment of a sentence that really resonated with me &#8211; highlighted in the quote below.</p>


<blockquote>
For copyrighted works, <span class="caps">VRM</span> could involve agreements made on an individual basis — ones that could involve actual relationships between copyright holders and their customers. For example, if I buy an open (non-DRM’d) copy of an album by Mike Marshall (my favorite mandolin player), it might involve letting him know who I am, the fact that I like his work, a commitment not to duplicate it beyond fair uses, and the option to do any number of things, <strong>including re-distributing it for pay that would get us both a slice of the take</strong>. The options are wide open. What matters is that there would means for a real reslationship based on mutual interest, trust and control.
</blockquote>

	<p>If I like something enough to want to recommend it to people why shouldn&#8217;t I take a small amount of money from any resulting transaction?  If I was to become an <a href="http://affiliate-program.amazon.co.uk/gp/associates/join/">Amazon affiliate</a> I could already get paid for recommending this album: except that I&#8217;d actually be getting paid for recommending this album <strong>at</strong> Amazon.  That just makes me feel a little less comfortable than if I was able to get paid for recommending the artist alone.</p>


	<p>Having spent about 30 minutes writing and re-writing to come up with that <strong>one</strong> paragraph above I&#8217;ve realised that I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on why I find the idea so powerful.</p>


	<p>Maybe one of the things I like is the decentralisation that the model would imply.  Rather than having one large distributor (Amazon) you have lots of smaller distributors (fans of Mike Marshall&#8217;s music).  Hmm, food for thought.</p>
