              <p>I&#8217;d read <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/07/17/instantIndexing.html">previously</a> about <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> indexing pages in almost real-time.  I only experienced it myself for the first time this evening.  I was continuing to search for answers to my <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/11/20/can-anyone-recommend-a-good-simple-web-hosting-solution">recent question</a> when my own question popped up at number three in the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&#38;q=static+simple+web+hosting">search results</a>.</p>

	<p>I assume this might be to do with Google&#8217;s <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/05/taking-advantage-of-universal-search.html">Universal Search</a> that blends lots of different sources into their main search results.  Or, they really do just love me.</p>

              <p>Nup, it cost me £5.00.  That&#8217;s not free is it.</p>


	<p>OK, so I&#8217;m being intentionally blunt, but that&#8217;s because <a href="http://www.google.com">google</a> annoyed me by being misleading and incompetent.  Although I have no intention of using <a href="http://adwords.google.com">adwords</a>, I had to sign-up in order to use their <a href="http://services.google.com/websiteoptimizer">website optimizer</a> service.  I signed up but chose not to enter any billing information; I wasn&#8217;t going to buy any ads, and website optimizer is free (hmmm), so I didn&#8217;t see the point.  I went on to set-up my optimizer experiments and waited.  The docs suggest that you may have to wait up to an hour before seeing impressions, but 24 hours without impressions, that I knew should be there, seemed a little excessive.  I guessed it may have had something to do with not entering my billing information but in order to be sure I sent the folks at google an email.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Chris</strong> I&#8217;ve set-up my website optimizer campaigns and all seems correct.  Unfortunately, they are not showing any impressions or clickthrus.  I wonder if this is because I haven&#8217;t activated (i.e. set-up my payment information) in my adwords account.  As I don&#8217;t intend to use adwords, I didn&#8217;t really want to have to do it.  Could this be the reason?</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>I thought I was being fairly clear in my questioning, but apparently not.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Adwords</strong> Thank you for your email regarding why you are not accruing any clicks or impression for your ad. I noticed that you have not entered your billing information. Below, I address this in detail.
I have reviewed your AdWords account and found that your ad is not appearing on Google because you have not yet entered your billing information. Entering valid billing information is required to activate your Google AdWords account and begin running your ads.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Surely it should be common practice to read the email before replying.  Obviously not.  Oh well, I&#8217;ll get back to them (in an admittedly sarcastic tone).</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Chris</strong> Any chance you can re-read my original query and answer that, rather than essentially ignoring it?</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Surely they&#8217;ll read it this time&#8230;</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Adwords</strong> Thank you for your email. I understand you would like to know why your ads are not receiving any clicks and impressions. Upon reviewing your account, I found that this is because your account has not been activated. To activate your account and to receive clicks and impressions you will have to enter your billing details</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Nope.  Let&#8217;s try one more time.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Chris</strong> I haven&#8217;t mentioned anything about adwords ads.  My problem is, in fact with Website Optimizer.  Do I need to enter billing information just to use website optimizer, or is there another reason that I&#8217;m not recording any hits?</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Woot, we get an answer.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Adwords</strong> The Website Optimizer is integrated into your AdWords account, you will need to enter your billing information to use it. In order to use Website Optimizer, you&#8217;ll need a Standard AdWords account.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Right, so we finally have a sensible answer.  In fact, I think this is probably covered in <a href="https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/index.py?fulldump=1#55902">this</a> answer, assuming that &#8220;active&#8221; means &#8220;with correct billing information&#8221;.  What about the £5.00 I had to pay to get set-up, of which there is no mention until the very last stage of sign-up?  Well, it actually seems that this is covered too, in <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#38;answer=31756">this</a> answer, mentioning a &#8220;nominal setup fee&#8221; to create an adwords account.</p>


	<p>In all fairness, the big G (not His Dad, the other one) has probably not done anything wrong, but it&#8217;s certainly not very transparent.  You have to pay to activate an adwords account and you need an adwords account in order to use website optimizer.  Or, website optimizer costs a fiver.  There, much easier to understand.</p>

              <p>I had need to view a powerpoint presentation on my Mac.  In the past, I&#8217;ve uploaded them to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net">slideshare</a>, but that wasn&#8217;t suitable in this instance.  A quick google reveals some free java software by tonic systems.  Unfortunately (well, fortunately for tonic systems), they&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.tonicsystems.com/">bought</a> by google and the link to their software has disappeared.  Luckily, the google cache has a copy of the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cache:4BswR-sgicYJ:www.tonicsystems.com/products/viewer/+tonicsystems+java+viewer&#38;hl=en&#38;ct=clnk&#38;cd=1&#38;gl=uk">original page</a> with a <a href="http://downloads.tonicsystems.com/viewer/TonicPointViewer-1.4-OSX.zip">working link</a> to the download.</p>


	<p>This probably won&#8217;t remain relevant very long, what with the recent <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/17/googles-office-suite-complete-google-powerpoint-confirmed/">news</a> of google adding a powerpoint clone to their office suite.</p>

              <p>So, I just saw a <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-01-04.html#n31">post</a> about <a href="http://www.gooogie.co.uk">gooogie</a>, and it reminded me of my <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2006/12/15/might-as-well-aim-high">own</a>, &#8216;did you mean&#8217;, page<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>


	<p>You can achieve the same effect as gooogie by using the excellent <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/">firebug</a> firefox extension to execute javascript in the context of the page you are viewing.</p>


	<p>To achieve the effect:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Open up <a href="http://www.google.co.uk">google</a></li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Type something into the search box that will generate a &#8216;did you mean&#8217; response (tip. use any <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&#38;q=mispeled&#38;btnG=Google+Search">misspelled</a> word)</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Use the handy <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1192/">XPather</a> firefox extension to find the XPath expression of the suggested word (in italics).  At this time, the relevant xpath seems to be &#8217;/html/body/p<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>/a/b/i&#8217;</li>
	</ul>


	<ul>
	<li>Fire up firebug and execute the following line in the console, substituting your desired suggestion first (the text on the page should change immediately)</li>
	</ul>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_default">document.evaluate('/html/body/p[1]/a/b/i', document, null, XPathResult.ANY_TYPE, null).iterateNext().textContent = 'THE_WORD_YOU_WANT_TO_SUGGEST'</code></pre></div>

	<ul>
	<li>Finish by typing a new word into the search box and taking a screenshot to impress your friends (or not, as the case may be).</li>
	</ul>


	<p>On second thoughts, just use gooogie, it&#8217;s much quicker and cross-browser compatible.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> A handful of people have stated that they don&#8217;t get the &#8216;did you mean reevoo&#8217; message when typing &#8216;review&#8217; into google.  Well, no, they wouldn&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s completely made up.  He he.</p>

              <h3>Short version</h3>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">ALWAYS</span></strong> create adverts (creatives) <strong>before</strong> keywords when setting up an ad group using the Adwords Api</p>


	<h3>Longer version</h3>


	<p>Our first use of the adwords api was to create around 850 ad groups, each with three text ads and one keyword.  Although the creation seemed to go to plan, a quick inspection in the adwords interface revealed that all of our ads were marked as inactive, with most of our keywords having a minimum bid of £2.50!</p>


	<p>Adding the exact same keywords and text ads manually resulted in active keywords, so we knew there was nothing wrong with our content.</p>


	<p>A few searches on google didn&#8217;t yield any relevant results, but searching the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/adwords-api">adwords api google group</a> seemed to reveal other people having the same problem.  The solution was (and is) simple &#8211; ensure that you create your keywords <strong>after</strong> you&#8217;ve created your ad content.  Indeed, it is impossible to create them in any other order from within the adwords interface itself.</p>


	<p>Right now this is just a pain, as it needlessly wastes api quota &#8211; about 700,000 in our case.  Come  <a href="http://adwordsapi.blogspot.com/2006/09/deadline-for-registration-and-billing.html">November 1st</a> this will cost you hard cash &#8211; around £80.00 &#8211; £90 for our 700,000&#8217;ish.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m hoping google will change their api to warn you when keywords are created before creatives, or, at the very least, make it extremely clear in the docs that there is an order in which the two should be created.  In the meantime, maybe this will help people searching google for an answer to the same problem.</p>
