              <p>I&#8217;ve often felt the need to search through our <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> repository to find, for example, when a method was removed/renamed.  As far as I&#8217;m aware there&#8217;s no easy way to do this using the standard subversion, or <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a>, tools.  A few days ago the need arose once more: I wanted to know when a particular class had stopped being used within our codebase.  It struck me that if I had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> file for each changeset that I&#8217;d be able to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> for the change I was looking for.  I hacked together a script to produce a diff of each changeset (actually, as I knew when the class was added, I only produced a diff for a subset of the changesets) and was able to find the information I needed.  The script is pasted below and on <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/svn_changesets/">google code</a>.  It assumes that you are running it from within an svn working direction.  It took a while to produce the diff files (I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have any stats) but the result was a really fast way of finding, otherwise hard to find, information.  I guess it&#8217;d be quite easy to automate the diff creation process so that you had an always up-to-date bunch of diff fies&#8230;</p>


	<p>Is this useful, or have I missed something obvious in Subversion or Trac that does exactly this?</p>

              <p>A couple of days ago I was playing around with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~clkao/SVN-Mirror-0.68/lib/SVN/Mirror.pm"><span class="caps">SVN</span>::Mirror</a>, trying to remove some <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Plugins">dependencies</a> on third party repositories not in our control.</p>


	<p>All was going well until I tried to mirror a <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/mocha/">project</a> hosted on rubyforge.  On initialising the mirror, I kept receiving the error &#8220;source url not under source root&#8221; from line 72 in Ra.pm.</p>


	<p>After some very careful debugging (yeah, like I know anything about perl &#8211; <code>print "1";</code> was about the extent of it) of that perl file; I noticed that the $source_root variable didn&#8217;t contain the double slash<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  This causes a problem for the line <code>if substr($path, 0, length($source_root), '') ne $source_root;</code> as at this point, $path does contain the double slash.</p>


	<p>The value of $source_root is returned from a call to RA-&gt;get_repos_root (Subversion Repository Access code).  So; it would seem that the url was being normalised somewhere in the bowels of <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>.</p>


	<p>This was kinda confirmed by testing the svn client (which uses the code in the RA module just like <span class="caps">SVN</span>::Mirror) with urls containing additional slashes.  The url was always resolved and svn info would always show the normalised variant.  It was additionally(ish) tested by using the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> <a href="http://svn.collab.net/viewvc/svn/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig/ruby/">bindings</a> (which, as an aside, contain just about the most difficult to read Ruby code I&#8217;ve ever come across!)</p>


	<p>I would love to have followed the actual subversion c code to find the normalisation routine but I&#8217;m sadly not clever enough; so my findings had to suffice.</p>


	<p>Anyhoo, the outcome of the story is that I emailed Tom Copeland of rubyforge fame to ask about the deal with the double slashes.  Turns out that it was probably just a <a href="http://gforge.org/">gforge</a> default thing and Tom went ahead and promptly changed it.  I suddenly got very nervous that lots of arms would be thrown up with cries of &#8220;Who broke rubyforge?&#8221;, but so far it would appears to be ok.  Phew.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Not sure if anyone else had really noticed but the svn repositories on rubyforge used to contain a double slash between the domain and var path (i.e. rubyforge.org//var).</p>
