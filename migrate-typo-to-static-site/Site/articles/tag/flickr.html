              <p>I wanted to get my thoughts down more than trying to write something particularly coherent so I apologise for the unstructured post.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to get this working for the last week or so, without much success.</p>


	<p>The first problem I ran into was my general impatience and incompetence.  I was able to receive emails to my 3mail.com address but sending of emails was not working (attachment or not).  I struggled alone for a bit before heading for the instruction manual and realising that I hadn&#8217;t actually configured my email settings.</p>


	<p>I needed to change the username (from the default &#8216;3Mail&#8217; to my mobile number) and the password (to the four digit code set-up at some point during the enrollment process).  I also changed the Mail address to my 3mail.com address but I&#8217;m not sure whether this was necessary or not.  Changing these settings allowed me to send email (I started by emailing my personal account).  As I was successfully receiving emails before these changes I can only assume that the username and password are required for <span class="caps">SMTP</span> and that <span class="caps">IMAP</span> authentication happens in some other, magical, way.</p>


	<p>The 3mail service appears to use standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol"><span class="caps">IMAP</span></a> (imap.three.co.uk) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></a> servers but I&#8217;m guessing that access is restricted by IP address.  I certainly couldn&#8217;t access them from my laptop on the end of an <span class="caps">ADSL</span> connection.</p>


	<p>I was monitoring the costs of the emails being sent and soon realised that every email that included a picture cost fifty pence.  I sent a simple text email with a tiny subject and body and it didn&#8217;t affect my credit at all so I&#8217;m not entirely sure of their charging model (it could be that I pay for attachments or just messages over a certain size).  I wondered whether the data used in sending the email would come out of an Internet bundles.  I purchased a fifty pence, one day, Internet bundle and sent another message: my credit decreased by fifty pence again.  D&#8217;oh.</p>


	<p>It might be useful to note that you can send one email to multiple recipients (I tried two) for the same price (fifty pence for the email with picture that I was sending).</p>


	<p>I emailed the same photo to <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> twice, cc&#8217;ing my personal address one occasion.  Neither email made it to flickr (well, it&#8217;s difficult to know that for sure but it certainly didn&#8217;t show up) but the email cc&#8217;d to me came through fine.  To ensure that &#8216;email to flickr&#8217; was working correctly, I sent the picture I&#8217;d just received to my flickr email address (copied from the email) and it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2199297357/">showed up</a> almost immediately.  Hmm, so I&#8217;ve now wasted a couple of quid and still can&#8217;t email my photos to flickr.</p>


	<p>I was able to send the message as a picture message to flickr (and my personal email) at a cost of twenty-five pence.  There are two (smallish) downsides to this approach: the pictures are resized to 640&#215;480 before sending and, as it goes through an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service"><span class="caps">MMS</span></a> to email translation phase, the email you receive doesn&#8217;t have the subject and body set correctly (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2199389895/">screenshot</a>).</p>

              </p>
          
              <p>I just wanted to write a short note to recommend <a href="http://www.photobox.co.uk">PhotoBox</a>.  I&#8217;ve been meaning to get some of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos">photos</a> printed for a while, but was put off by having to pay for a service that I knew nothing about.  A short while ago, a friend <a href="http://ademblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/is-that-where-it-ends-with-your-life.html">mentioned</a> photobox.  Not only do I trust Adem&#8217;s opinion, but photobox were (and still are, having just checked their homepage) offering 30 free prints when you sign-up.  I signed up at around midday on Friday (23rd Feb 2007), selected 30 photos that I&#8217;d like printed, and uploaded them to photobox.  I paid my Â£1.50 postage and duly received my confirmation email at 16:27 that day.  The best thing was that 56 minutes later (17:23) I received an email to say that the photos had been dispatched.  That&#8217;s pretty cool.  They were sent First Class with <a href="http://www.royalmail.co.uk">Royal Mail</a> and I received them the next morning.</p>


	<p>I know that Adem has already used their service again, and I can only imagine that I will too.  Would I have used them without Adem&#8217;s advocacy?  Probably if they had the free offer (I&#8217;d have nothing to lose after all), almost certainly not if they didn&#8217;t.</p>


	<p>After all that praise, I&#8217;d like to suggest a couple of improvements.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>I already have all of my photos on <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a>.  I should have been able to supply photobox with the location of these photos rather than having to painstakingly download and re-upload.</li>
		<li>I found the interface a little clumsy.  At the checkout, it looked like some of my photos were going to be cropped, even though I didn&#8217;t ask for it, or see why they would be (they were &#8216;photo-size&#8217; already.)  This resulted in a bit of back and forth, on my part, through the interface, to ensure I hadn&#8217;t selected some option by mistake (I hadn&#8217;t and my photos weren&#8217;t cropped.)  I feel that it could be made easier for the &#8216;just upload and print&#8217; crowd.</li>

              <p>So, it seems far more difficult than it should be to retrieve a bunch of <strong>my</strong> photos from flickr.com.  Having unsuccessfully experimented with some of the flickr libs on <a href="http://www.rubyforge.org">rubyforge</a> I hacked this together.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong>: Something caused curl to get &#8216;stuck&#8217; downloading a particular picture so I amended the script to ensure it ignores already downloaded files.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE 2</span></strong>: Surround output filename with quotes.</p>
