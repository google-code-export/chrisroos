              <p>I wanted to get my thoughts down more than trying to write something particularly coherent so I apologise for the unstructured post.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to get this working for the last week or so, without much success.</p>


	<p>The first problem I ran into was my general impatience and incompetence.  I was able to receive emails to my 3mail.com address but sending of emails was not working (attachment or not).  I struggled alone for a bit before heading for the instruction manual and realising that I hadn&#8217;t actually configured my email settings.</p>


	<p>I needed to change the username (from the default &#8216;3Mail&#8217; to my mobile number) and the password (to the four digit code set-up at some point during the enrollment process).  I also changed the Mail address to my 3mail.com address but I&#8217;m not sure whether this was necessary or not.  Changing these settings allowed me to send email (I started by emailing my personal account).  As I was successfully receiving emails before these changes I can only assume that the username and password are required for <span class="caps">SMTP</span> and that <span class="caps">IMAP</span> authentication happens in some other, magical, way.</p>


	<p>The 3mail service appears to use standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol"><span class="caps">IMAP</span></a> (imap.three.co.uk) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP"><span class="caps">SMTP</span></a> servers but I&#8217;m guessing that access is restricted by IP address.  I certainly couldn&#8217;t access them from my laptop on the end of an <span class="caps">ADSL</span> connection.</p>


	<p>I was monitoring the costs of the emails being sent and soon realised that every email that included a picture cost fifty pence.  I sent a simple text email with a tiny subject and body and it didn&#8217;t affect my credit at all so I&#8217;m not entirely sure of their charging model (it could be that I pay for attachments or just messages over a certain size).  I wondered whether the data used in sending the email would come out of an Internet bundles.  I purchased a fifty pence, one day, Internet bundle and sent another message: my credit decreased by fifty pence again.  D&#8217;oh.</p>


	<p>It might be useful to note that you can send one email to multiple recipients (I tried two) for the same price (fifty pence for the email with picture that I was sending).</p>


	<p>I emailed the same photo to <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> twice, cc&#8217;ing my personal address one occasion.  Neither email made it to flickr (well, it&#8217;s difficult to know that for sure but it certainly didn&#8217;t show up) but the email cc&#8217;d to me came through fine.  To ensure that &#8216;email to flickr&#8217; was working correctly, I sent the picture I&#8217;d just received to my flickr email address (copied from the email) and it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2199297357/">showed up</a> almost immediately.  Hmm, so I&#8217;ve now wasted a couple of quid and still can&#8217;t email my photos to flickr.</p>


	<p>I was able to send the message as a picture message to flickr (and my personal email) at a cost of twenty-five pence.  There are two (smallish) downsides to this approach: the pictures are resized to 640&#215;480 before sending and, as it goes through an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service"><span class="caps">MMS</span></a> to email translation phase, the email you receive doesn&#8217;t have the subject and body set correctly (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/2199389895/">screenshot</a>).</p>

              <p>Are Tesco Entertainment the new <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/03/16/orange-orange-orange">Orange</a>?  They might just be you know.  See, I&#8217;ve been sad and pathetic enough to <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions">record</a> details of unwanted emails that I receive.  So far <a href="http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment">Tesco Entertainment</a>, bless &#8216;em, have been unable to remove me from their mailing list for 90 days.  I thought I&#8217;d write them a little email to, you know, ask them to stop spamming me.</p>


<blockquote>
Here&#8217;s a list of emails you&#8217;ve sent me.

	<ul>
	<li>Received: 26-Jun-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 11-Jul-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 27-Jul-2007</li>
		<li><strong>Unsubscribed</strong>: 30-Jul-2007 (although it appeared that I wasn’t actually signed up to any offers…)</li>
		<li>Received: 08-Aug-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 21-Aug-2007</li>
		<li>Received: 16-Oct-2007</li>
		<li>I emailed you on 17th Oct:
“I unsubscribed from you guys on the 30th July 2007 (interestingly, my preferences suggested that I wasn’t actually subscribed to any mailings in the first place). Since then, you’ve sent me Tesco Entertainment emails on the 8th Aug, 21st Aug and 16th Oct1. Please stop.  Cheers,  Chris  [1] http://chrisjroos.stikipad.com/unsubscriptions/show/tesco-entertainment”</li>
		<li>Received: 30-Oct-2007</li>
	</ul>


	<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I&#8217;ve received four emails since unsubscribing on the 30th July.  I think three months is long enough to remove someone from your spam list isn&#8217;t it?  Oh, and you&#8217;ll also see I&#8217;ve emailed you in the past too.  It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to reply would it?</p>


	<p>Cheers,</p>


Chris

	<p><strong>Update Thu 15th Nov 2007</strong></p>


	<p>I received a reply from Tesco.</p>

              <p>I haven&#8217;t done any research on this so it may have already been proposed over at the <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a> site.</p>


	<h3>The problem</h3>


	<p>Sometimes I want to communicate with the author of a webpage.  I don&#8217;t want to have to hunt around to find contact details and I probably don&#8217;t want to fill in a form.</p>


	<h3>A proposal to fix part of the problem</h3>


	<p>If the author&#8217;s contact details were semantically marked up, either on the page I was looking at or linked to elsewhere on the web, then I could use a simple parser to extract those details and select the best communication tool to use manually.</p>


	<p>Maybe some code can help explain what I mean.</p>


	<h4>A semantically marked up contact page.</h4>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot;&gt;

&lt;html&gt;

  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Contact Details&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;dl class=&quot;contactDetails&quot;&gt;
      &lt;dt&gt;Skype&lt;/dt&gt;
      &lt;dd class=&quot;skype identifier&quot;&gt;skype-username&lt;/dd&gt;
      &lt;dt&gt;MSN&lt;/dt&gt;
      &lt;dd class=&quot;msn identifier&quot;&gt;msn-username&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;/dl&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></div>

	<h3>Further considerations</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>If existing communication tools<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> were to integrate this parser then it would be easy to add a contact by giving the url of, for example, their blog.</li>
		<li>Author&#8217;s should be able to specify the order of the tools that they wish to use for communication.  We could just assume that the list of contact details is in the author&#8217;s preferred order.</li>
		<li>This would be open to spam.  Err, not too sure what to do about this.</li>
		<li>Ultimately, I&#8217;d like to hit a &#8216;communicate&#8217; button in <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">firefox</a> that automatically decides which communication protocols we have in common and allows me to get my message through.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Anyone have any thoughts?</p>


	<p>Code is all over on <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/contact-microformat/">google code</a>.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I&#8217;m thinking of multi protocol tools, like <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">adium</a>, in particular.</p>
