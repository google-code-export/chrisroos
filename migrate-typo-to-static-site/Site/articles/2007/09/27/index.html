              </p>
          
              <p>I&#8217;ve started looking into my *cough* promise *cough* to do that <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/06/01/an-open-letter-to-my-local-newspapers">local paper</a> site I mentioned sometime ago.  The code is all in me <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com">google code</a> <a href="http://chrisroos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/the-local-paper/">repository</a> if you want to see how it&#8217;s going (or finish it when I inevitably get bored again&#8230;).</p>


	<p>Anyway, the point of this post is that I realised something about testing that I feel I may have missed in the past.  I&#8217;ve got used to stating the <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">behavior</a> of the objects in my system through tests.  So, when I wanted to ensure that an article couldn&#8217;t be created without a title, I added a test like so:</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_ruby"><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="class">ArticleTest</span> <span class="punct">&lt;</span> <span class="constant">Test</span><span class="punct">::</span><span class="constant">Unit</span><span class="punct">::</span><span class="constant">TestCase</span>
  <span class="keyword">def </span><span class="method">test_should_validate_presence_of_title</span>
    <span class="punct">...</span>
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span></code></pre></div>

	<p>In fact, for an article comprised of a title, an edition, a page number and an author, I wanted to ensure that all were there apart from the author.  It was only once I&#8217;d added tests to <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations.html">validate</a> the presence of the other three attributes that I realised it was probably important to prove that an author wasn&#8217;t required.  So, I added the relevant test.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_ruby"><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="class">ArticleTest</span> <span class="punct">&lt;</span> <span class="constant">Test</span><span class="punct">::</span><span class="constant">Unit</span><span class="punct">::</span><span class="constant">TestCase</span>
  <span class="keyword">def </span><span class="method">test_should_not_validate_presence_of_author</span>
    <span class="punct">...</span>
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span></code></pre></div>

	<p>That&#8217;s all well and good, but I&#8217;ve lost some information: <span class="caps">WHY</span> it shouldn&#8217;t validate the presence of an author.  I know at the moment why it shouldn&#8217;t (because short articles don&#8217;t have an author listed), but will I know at some point the future?  I suspect not.  The same obviously applies for the things that I do want to ensure are present.  Why do I care that an article has a title, edition and page number?  At the moment I care because I&#8217;m planning on making them part of the <span class="caps">URL</span>, but what if I decide not to go down that route, yet leave the tests there?  There&#8217;ll be no easy way for someone in the future to determine whether those things are actually important or not.</p>


	<p>I wonder if this issue was highlighted because of my lack of <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"><span class="caps">SVN</span></a> access.  I generally like really small checkins to my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">version control software</a> which would&#8217;ve allowed me to have added and committed those validation additions one at a time, and with messages that would have stated the reasons for that change<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  Being disconnected means that I end up with bigger checkins that inevitably lose some information.  Actually, the more I think about it, the more I think that the repository isn&#8217;t the right place for this information anyway &#8211; it&#8217;s too far away from the code that&#8217;s solving the problems.</p>


	<p>How do other people solve this potential loss of knowledge?  Am I missing something obvious, or have I really just not noticed this before?</p>


	<p>P.S. I spent a few minutes chatting with <a href="http://interblah.net/">James</a> about it today and he had some interesting suggestions, although I&#8217;ll leave it up to him to share those if he wants (no pressure James, I&#8217;m just running out of time right now I&#8217;m afraid).</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> <a href="http://po-ru.com">Paul</a> suggested a while back that we use the commit note to explain the problem that we&#8217;ve solved, rather than just describing the changeset.  Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t find the source of that suggestion so no link I&#8217;m afraid.</p>
