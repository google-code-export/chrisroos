              <p>It took me a while, but I&#8217;ve come up with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">stories</a> to represent the feature requests from the <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">reevoo.com</a> <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2007/08/23/responses-to-reevoo-com-feedback">feedback</a>.</p>


	<p>I (well <a href="http://www.po-ru.com">Paul</a> actually) even took a photo to prove it.</p>


	<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos/1284248507"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1175/1284248507_c7d8653554_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>


	<p>We have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming_Practices#Planning_game">planning game</a> next Tuesday (4th Sep) so we&#8217;ll have to wait to see if any of them get in.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve written the cards out in full below.  If anyone recognises one of their requests and thinks I&#8217;ve misrepresented it then feel free to let me know.</p>


	<h3>Remove search filters</h3>


	<p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to be able to remove filters in the same way that I can add them, so that I don&#8217;t have to start my search again if I want to change my search criteria.</p>


	<h3>Display scores of related products</h3>


	<p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to see the scores of &#8216;related products&#8217;, so that I can instantly decide whether those products might be of interest to me.</p>


	<h3>Display usefulness of reviews</h3>


	<p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to know how useful the reviews are, so that I can get a feel for the &#8216;importance&#8217; of a review.</p>


	<h3>Favicon</h3>


	<p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to immediately identify your favicon with reevoo branding, so that I can immediately pick it out in my search history and browser tabs.</p>


	<h3>Recently viewed products</h3>


	<p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to see a list of my recently viewed products, so that I can easily find my way back to the products I&#8217;m interested in.</p>


	<h3>Scores obviously out of 10</h3>


	<p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want it to be obvious that the review scores are out of 10, so that I don&#8217;t waste time trying to work it out and can, instead, find the products that I&#8217;m interested in.</p>


	<h3>Product count on supercategory pages</h3>


	<p>As a user of reevoo.com, I always want to see the number of products appear next to the product category, so that I can easily scan down the list of categories.</p>


	<h3>General comments</h3>


	<p>As a user of reevoo.com, I want to be able to immediately identify that the general comments are indeed general comments, so that I don&#8217;t waste time trying to work out what they are and whether they&#8217;re important.</p>
