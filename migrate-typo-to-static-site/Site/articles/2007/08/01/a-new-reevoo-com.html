                <p>I like it!  Although the constantly updating map quickly became distracting as I looked at the rest of the home page.  Perhaps it could stop after a few reviews with a link over the map saying &#8220;see more&#8221; or you could add a button to stop it&#8230;</p>

                <p>Hey Doug,</p>


	<p>Thanks for the feedback.  I&#8217;ve personally not found the map distracting &#8211; but then I&#8217;m not often on the homepage so my views probably shouldn&#8217;t count :-).  One oversight, in my view, is that it currently takes at least two clicks to get from the homepage to any reviews.  In fact, I might try to sort that today.</p>


	<p>Cheers.</p>

                <p>One very quick initial comment is that on the homepage the reviews that pop-up need to have a link to the associated product page. The actual product review pages are clearer now, I had to laugh at one reviewer&#8217;s negative points regarding the Canon <span class="caps">EOS 400D</span>&#8230;</p>


	<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s not possible to crop pictures on the lcd and then to save them. Quite a drawback if you don&#8217;t have the time to fiddle around on the computer.&#8221;</em></p>

                <p>One more point; using light-blue text on the site makes it hard to distinguish where there are hyper-links (darker-blue text). This is especially noticeable on the <span class="caps">FAQ</span> page.</p>

                <p>Hey Ben,</p>


	<p>I completely agree that the reviews need to link through to the product review pages.  Although it&#8217;s very unlikely to be of a product you&#8217;re interested in, it would allow people to get a feel for the product pages immediately.</p>


	<p>As for the links, I see your point too.  The grey visited-link colour isn&#8217;t particular clear either.  Some work to do there I think.</p>


	<p>Cheers</p>
