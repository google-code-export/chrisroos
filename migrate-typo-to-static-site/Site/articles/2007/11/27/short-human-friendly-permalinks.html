            <p>I was recently asked for my Amazon wishlist.  I wasn&#8217;t able to use email and was expected to write down the <span class="caps">URL</span>.  I had a look and found that the <span class="caps">URL</span> (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/IO9HVNCPEWGD">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/IO9HVNCPEWGD</a>) wasn&#8217;t paper or speech friendly.  Instead of attempting to convey this <span class="caps">URL</span>, I used the opportunity to create my own human friendly permalink for my wishlist (<a href="http://chrisroos.co.uk/amazonwishlist">chrisroos.co.uk/amazonwishlist</a>).  I actually started with a hyphenated variant (amazon-wishlist) but realised that the non-hyphenated version would be easier for someone to understand in conversation.</p>


	<p>This seems to tie in with what <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> has been talking about <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/11/20/solvingTheTinyurlCentraliz.html">recently</a>.</p>


	<p>I think this&#8217;d be quite a neat, and fairly easy, little webapp to build.  It would need a simple interface for managing permalinks and the ability to work with multiple domains.  Hmm, I&#8217;m tempted to give this a shot unless anyone knows of anything similar already out there?</p>

                <p>It wouldn&#8217;t be too hard to make hyphenation optional, and to redirect to the canonical version.</p>


	<p>The <span class="caps">BBC</span> do something clever with their URLs, actually: many of them are communicated by being read out over the air, so they are short and sweet and handle ambiguity: http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/ is canonical; http://www.bbc.co.uk/radiofour/ redirects to radio4. (And of course, http, www, and trailing slashes are dealt with higher up the application stack.)</p>


	<p>They don&#8217;t handle hyphens, however. Maybe they should.</p>
