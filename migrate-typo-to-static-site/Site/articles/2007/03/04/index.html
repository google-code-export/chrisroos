              <p>I just wanted to write a short note to recommend <a href="http://www.photobox.co.uk">PhotoBox</a>.  I&#8217;ve been meaning to get some of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisjroos">photos</a> printed for a while, but was put off by having to pay for a service that I knew nothing about.  A short while ago, a friend <a href="http://ademblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/is-that-where-it-ends-with-your-life.html">mentioned</a> photobox.  Not only do I trust Adem&#8217;s opinion, but photobox were (and still are, having just checked their homepage) offering 30 free prints when you sign-up.  I signed up at around midday on Friday (23rd Feb 2007), selected 30 photos that I&#8217;d like printed, and uploaded them to photobox.  I paid my Â£1.50 postage and duly received my confirmation email at 16:27 that day.  The best thing was that 56 minutes later (17:23) I received an email to say that the photos had been dispatched.  That&#8217;s pretty cool.  They were sent First Class with <a href="http://www.royalmail.co.uk">Royal Mail</a> and I received them the next morning.</p>


	<p>I know that Adem has already used their service again, and I can only imagine that I will too.  Would I have used them without Adem&#8217;s advocacy?  Probably if they had the free offer (I&#8217;d have nothing to lose after all), almost certainly not if they didn&#8217;t.</p>


	<p>After all that praise, I&#8217;d like to suggest a couple of improvements.</p>


	<ol>
	<li>I already have all of my photos on <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a>.  I should have been able to supply photobox with the location of these photos rather than having to painstakingly download and re-upload.</li>
		<li>I found the interface a little clumsy.  At the checkout, it looked like some of my photos were going to be cropped, even though I didn&#8217;t ask for it, or see why they would be (they were &#8216;photo-size&#8217; already.)  This resulted in a bit of back and forth, on my part, through the interface, to ensure I hadn&#8217;t selected some option by mistake (I hadn&#8217;t and my photos weren&#8217;t cropped.)  I feel that it could be made easier for the &#8216;just upload and print&#8217; crowd.</li>
	</ol>
