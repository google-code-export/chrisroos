              <p>I updated Typo last night to run from svn trunk, just to get the added benefit of pinging sites like <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs</a> and <a href="http://www.technorati.com">technorati</a> whenever I publish an article.  All was running smoothly until I just tried to create the newsreader article.  On saving, I get a not very helpful Rails app error.  The logs didn&#8217;t help an amazing amount either&#8230;</p>


	<p>It was at around this point that I remembered that my shared hosting account didn&#8217;t actually allow for certain low level network access (e.g. <acronym title="Internet Control Message Protocol">ICMP</acronym>) from my virtual machine.  Sure enough, disabling the auto-ping option made the error go away.  Having looked a bit further it would appear that the articles were actually being saved but I was seeing the error when the ping request was timing out.  This has already been reported on <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/ticket/400">typo trac</a>.  I must admit I don&#8217;t know the exact cause of the problem here but am guessing that the blog ping&#8217;s require access to some network operation that I don&#8217;t have permissions for&#8230;</p>


	<p><strong><em>update Fri 7th Oct</em></strong></p>


	<p>Mmmm, seems I was being stupid in my assumption.  The &#8216;blog pings&#8217; just transfer data over http, nothing lower than that.  As such, the problem must have been caused by a non-respondent ping server at the time I was trying to save.  In fact, I just created a new test article and enabled the pings and all worked fine.  Oops.</p>

              <p>It&#8217;s been on my list for quite a while to check out online newsreaders in order to replace my flagging <a href="http://www.sharpreader.com">desktop client of choice</a>.</p>


	<p>This has been pushed up the list by my recent contract taking me away from my main machine for the best part of the week.  As such, I spent last night looking at some of the alternatives listed on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_news_aggregators#Online_news_aggregators">this</a> <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a> article.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m currently torn between <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">bloglines</a> and <a href="http://www.bloxor.com">blox0r</a> and although bloxor was slightly ahead last night I&#8217;ve actually been using bloglines more during the day today.</p>


	<p>Blox0r is a <acronym title="XML User interface Language">XUL</acronym> app which means that it only runs in Mozilla browsers (I think).  This provides for a very rich and clean interface which suits me perfectly.  Unfortunately, I&#8217;m just not 100% sure that it&#8217;s doing exactly what I expect it to be doing &#8211; a handful of feeds are not rendering as they should which makes me wonder what else may not be working correctly.  Hence my current persuasion toward bloglines, which although looks a little too &#8216;full featured&#8217; for my needs is at least rendering all of my feeds correctly.</p>


	<p>I also tested the following services last night, none of which seemed to come up to scratch.  Feed lounge actually looks very promising but is currently in a non public alpha so I&#8217;ll have to wait a little longer on that one.</p>
