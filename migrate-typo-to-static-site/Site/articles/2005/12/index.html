              <p>(Probably) the standard way to print to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF">Pdf</a> in Windows is to buy <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/main.html">Adobe Acrobat</a> or use one of the alternatives (which come with various different licences and are of varying quality; from experience over the last couple of years).</p>


	<p>There is, however, a completely free alternative, providing you don&#8217;t mind going through a couple of steps to implement it (which I don&#8217;t).</p>


	<p>The basic premise is that you print to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a> using a PostScript compatible printer driver and then use <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript</a> to convert from PostScript to Pdf.</p>


	<p>These instructions work in Windows XP but should be very similar in all versions of Windows.</p>


	<h3>Install PostScript compatible printer.</h3>


	<ol>
	<li>Add a Printer.</li>
		<li>Choose &#8216;Local printer&#8217; and do not &#8216;automatically detect&#8217;.</li>
		<li>Select &#8216;FILE: (Print to File)&#8217; in the list next to &#8216;Use the following port&#8217;.</li>
		<li>Choose a PS printer.  I&#8217;m currently using HP Color LaserJet PS.</li>
		<li>Select whether you want to use this as your default printer and choose no to printing a test page.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Download and install <span class="caps">AFPL</span> Ghostscript</h3>


	<ol>
	<li>Visit the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript site</a> and follow the &#8216;Obtaining <span class="caps">AFPL</span> Ghostscript <version>&#8217; link.</li>
		<li>Download the version for Windows, which at the time of writing is called  gs853w32.exe.</li>
		<li>Double click the downloaded file to install.  Use the defaults during installation.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Download and install GSview</h3>


	<ol>
	<li>Visit the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/index.htm">GSview site</a> and follow the &#8216;Obtaining GSview 4.7 link&#8217;.</li>
		<li>Download the version for Windows, which at the time of writing is called  gsv47w32.exe.</li>
		<li>Double click the downloaded file to install.  Use the defaults during installation.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Print something</h3>


	<ol>
	<li>Open a file and choose to print to your PostScript printer.</li>
		<li>On clicking the Print button, you will be prompted to specify a filename to save the PostScript document to.  Supply the full path to the file here, for example &#8216;c:\page.ps&#8217;.  Although the .ps extension is optional it makes it easier to open directly in GSview if this is supplied.</li>
	</ol>


	<h3>Convert the PostScript file to Pdf</h3>


	<ol>
	<li>Double click on the &#8216;c:\page.ps&#8217; file to open it in GSview.</li>
		<li>Click OK to close the software registration prompt and you will see the PostScript interpretation of your file on the screen.</li>
		<li>Click File &gt; Convert and choose &#8216;pdfwrite&#8217; as the device, a suitable resolution (default of 600 should be fine) and click OK.  You will be prompted to save the converted Pdf file somewhere</li>
		<li>Enter the filename to save the file with, noting that .pdf doesn&#8217;t get added automatically, e.g. specify page.pdf.</li>
		<li>Open the new .pdf file in either <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Adobe Reader</a> or <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/13/windows-adobe-acrobat-reader-alternative">an alternative</a></li>

              <p>Yay.  I made my <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/3189">first patch</a> for <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m just waiting for a response along the lines of &#8216;thats by design crazy fool&#8217;, or similar&#8230;</p>

              <p>I was taking a look at the <a href="http://web2.wsj2.com/the_best_web_20_software_of_2005.htm">best web 2.0 software</a> when I came across a to do list alternative to <a href="http://www.tadalist.com">tada</a> called <a href="http://voo2do.com/">voo2do</a>.</p>


	<p>I just signed up to take a look, but unfortunately wasn&#8217;t amazingly impressed.  Fortunately it is easy to <a href="http://blog.seagul.co.uk/articles/2005/11/26/it-should-be-easy-to-cancel-online-accounts">cancel your account</a>.</p>


	<p>It is obviously subjective but the interface to voo2do isn&#8217;t amazing, although there is some great use of Ajax to let you tab between input fields when entering tasks.  I also found it too complicated for my simple mind.  I guess I think a to do list should literally be a list of one line items that need to be done at some/any point in time (which is exactly what tada offers, nothing more and nothing less).  I think that once you need something more than that, it probably doesn&#8217;t live on a todo list but in something slightly more structured.</p>


	<p>I certainly think there are improvements that could be made to tada (some of which can be overcome with the use of <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">greasemonkey</a> and this <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/754">tada user script</a>) but for now it&#8217;s going to be what I stick with.</p>

              <p>I&#8217;ve been using the reminders feature of <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">backpack</a> to text me when I need to be doing something time specific.  As per <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?id=16">this</a> thread in the forum, although I get the text messages, there is no subject; meaning I have to remember what it was that I wanted to be reminded about.  Hmmm.</p>


	<p>Following the advice from that thread, I just set-up a forwarding rule on my <a href="http://www.fastmail.fm">email providers</a> server to forward reminder alerts from backpack to my orange account.  This is in place of getting backpack to send directly to my orange email.  I now get the subjects in my text messages as expected.  Yay.</p>
