            <p>I often come across resources on the web that I&#8217;m interested in but want to look at in more detail later.  I currently use a combination of: storing urls in text files, placing links in my <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">backpack</a>, storing bookmarks in my browser and, in the past, tagging links with <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/to_read">to_read</a> in <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>.  I inevitably end up forgetting where I&#8217;ve stored these &#8216;bookmarks&#8217; and therefore miss out on that resource<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  In an attempt to consolidate places I can hide information, I&#8217;ve created a todo bundle in del.icio.us that currently contains the to_watch and to_read tags.  Doing that today ensured that I remembered to watch a <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">great presentation</a> by <a href="http://blame.ca/dick/">Dick Hardt</a> on the subject of <a href="http://www.identity20.com">identity 2.0</a>.  Cool.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> You could probably argue that because I forget about the resource, I can&#8217;t have been <em>that</em> interested in the first place&#8230;</p>

                <p>Lotus has plans: the Elise is going to get a detuned Exige engine (220 <span class="caps">BHP</span> without an intercooler), a new Exige SR model will feature launch and traction control systems, California series Elise and Exige models are in the pipeline for the boulevard cruising crowd, and Lotus is also going to inject some luxury into the Europa. But the big news which isn&#8217;t the Esprit is the Lotus Eagle, which will be &#8220;a mid engined four seater&#8221; made of aluminum for the luxury lifestyle set. Lotus <span class="caps">CEO</span> Mike Kimberley said there will be seven (count &#8216;em, seven) versions of the car, and in a crow eating first for Lotus, the car will have paddle shifters. Lotus had previously sworn never to include them on a car, citing purity of the driving experience. But what does the market care for driving purity? (Insert maniacal laugh here.) The Eagle arrives at the end of 2008. The much anticipated, exceedingly long awaited Lotus Esprit was sent back for reworking by Kimberley, who said it didn&#8217;t have enough&#8230;<br><a href="http://all-info-here.com/news/2490">http://all-info-here.com/</a></p>
