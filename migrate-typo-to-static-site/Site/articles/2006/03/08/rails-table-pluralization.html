            <p>I was talking to someone recently about the pluralisation of table names in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">rails</a>.  It was grating him because some hand built queries no longer read very naturally.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_sql">-- (in rails) requesting the forename of the 'first' person
SELECT forename FROM people WHERE people.id = 1;

-- would read better as
SELECT forename FROM person WHERE person.id = 1;</code></pre></div>

	<p><a href="http://po-ru.com/">Paul</a> (a colleague at <a href="http://www.reevoo.com">reevoo</a>) pointed out that there are two sides to the singular/plural table name debate.  You will always have some queries (as above) that will work better when the table is singular; and others (as below) that will work better when the table is plural.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_sql">-- requesting all people having a country of 'uk'
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country = 'UK';

-- (in rails) would read better as
SELECT * FROM people WHERE country = 'UK';</code></pre></div>

	<p>Personally, because of the very small amount of hand written sql I&#8217;ve had to use with Rails this has never been an issue to me.  However, it did make me think about a slight adaptation to Active Record&#8230;</p>


	<p>By default (in Rails), you create a singular (active record) model (person) that maps to the plural table (people).  Although very convenient (it&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;ve rarely had to touch sql), it too suffers from the same problems outlined in the queries above.  I think the two statements below show the same sort of natural vs unnatural language that appears in the sql above.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_ruby"><span class="comment"># good english (acting on a single person)</span>
<span class="constant">Person</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">name</span> <span class="punct">=</span> <span class="punct">'</span><span class="string">chris</span><span class="punct">'</span>
<span class="constant">Person</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">save</span>

<span class="comment"># bad english (we are asking for multiple people)</span>
<span class="constant">Person</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">find</span><span class="punct">(</span><span class="symbol">:all</span><span class="punct">,</span> <span class="symbol">:conditions</span> <span class="punct">=&gt;</span> <span class="punct">&quot;</span><span class="string">country = 'uk'</span><span class="punct">&quot;)</span></code></pre></div>

	<p>The adaptation to active record I was thinking about would allow you to operate on both a Person and People, using the variant that made the code read more naturally.  That is, we could leave the Person.name example above as is, but change the Person.find to People.find<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  There are different ways to go about this but to get some of the way there with a little code (i.e. not having to manually create both singular and plural classes for each table); I came up with the following simple hack.</p>


<div class="typocode"><pre><code class="typocode_ruby"><span class="keyword">class </span><span class="class">ActiveRecord::Base</span>
  <span class="keyword">class </span><span class="punct">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="constant">self</span>
    <span class="ident">alias_method</span> <span class="symbol">:__existing_inherited</span><span class="punct">,</span> <span class="symbol">:inherited</span>
    <span class="keyword">def </span><span class="method">inherited</span><span class="punct">(</span><span class="ident">child</span><span class="punct">)</span>
      <span class="ident">__existing_inherited</span><span class="punct">(</span><span class="ident">child</span><span class="punct">)</span>
      <span class="ident">plural_class</span> <span class="punct">=</span> <span class="ident">child</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">to_s</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">pluralize</span>
      <span class="keyword">unless</span> <span class="ident">plural_class</span> <span class="punct">=~</span> <span class="punct">/</span><span class="regex">#&lt;Class:.</span><span class="punct">/</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="constant">Object</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">constants</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">include?</span><span class="punct">(</span><span class="ident">plural_class</span><span class="punct">)</span>
        <span class="constant">Object</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">const_set</span><span class="punct">(</span><span class="ident">plural_class</span><span class="punct">,</span> <span class="constant">Class</span><span class="punct">.</span><span class="ident">new</span><span class="punct">(</span><span class="ident">child</span><span class="punct">))</span>
      <span class="keyword">end</span>
    <span class="keyword">end</span>
  <span class="keyword">end</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span></code></pre></div>

	<p>Just add it to the bottom of your environment.rb file and when you first reference one of your singular classes it will automatically descend a plural class from it.</p>


	<p>There are lots of things wrong with this code and many better ways for it to be implemented but it was really just for me to see if I could do it.</p>


	<p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Boring and sad.  I was going to start that sentence with i.e. but wasn&#8217;t sure whether that was grammatically correct (I&#8217;m not very good at English).  I did a quick search and found that it translates as &#8216;that is&#8217; from the Latin which is much better.</p>
