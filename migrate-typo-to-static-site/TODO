* Add number of comments to bottom of posts when in 'list' view, i.e. when shown as part of a tag (or on homepage etc)

* Redirect /index.html to /

* In currently deployed typo /articles is exactly the same as / - it should redirect

* IDEA - add a little description to each description that i can use when displaying a long list of articles (e.g. /articles/2007)

* Add meta description

* The use of fn1 breaks xhtml (multiple ids with same value) when multiple articles are shown on one page

* Year#months or Month as first class object???
