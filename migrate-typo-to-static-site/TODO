* Add number of comments to bottom of posts when in 'list' view, i.e. when shown as part of a tag (or on homepage etc)

* Redirect /index.html to /

* In currently deployed typo /articles is exactly the same as / - it should redirect

* IDEA - add a little description to each description that i can use when displaying a long list of articles (e.g. /articles/2007)

* Add meta description

* The use of fn1 breaks xhtml (multiple ids with same value) when multiple articles are shown on one page

* What to do for the main articles resource?  i can't sensibly display all articles so i guess i'll need to add some paging.  unless the main articles resource only shows the last X posts.  You must then navigate/search for any older posts.
** Or, maybe I can display all posts if only a snippet is shown..
** Or, a contents page with a list of all articles

* Employ compression for html pages

* Feed icon needs to be copied over from typo r1219
