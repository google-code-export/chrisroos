* forward myself emails from other web based email clients and test them out.

* Think about dealing with emails forwarded inline (ala gmail forwarded fellas)

* Check that the attachment is a text attachment before saving - see driving license email for reference

* keep a log of emailed messages so as to avoid repeatedly sending emails about them (maybe have in/out queues for emails)

* Obfuscate the email address in some way - even if it's only replacing a@b.com with a [at] b dot com, or a@b....
