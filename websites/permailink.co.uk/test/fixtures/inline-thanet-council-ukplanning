Dear Mr Roos

Thank you for your email of 10 July 2008, to which I refer.

Please accept my apologies for the delay in replying.

At present, Thanet District Council publishes planning applications on
www.ukplanning.com for public access. You are correct that as this is
a commercial enterprise 'scraping' details is not permitted. The
Council is working towards a system where plans are published on its
own website, which will change the way the public can access planning
applications.

The contents of your email of 10 July are currently receiving
attention from the Applications Manager Simon Thomas
(simon.thomas@thanet.gov.uk) and our Business Support Manager Helan
Wing (helan.wing@thanet.gov.uk).

You will appreciate that as the IT systems for publishing planning
applications on the Council's website are under development I cannot
confirm at the present time whether data will be available to feed
into the planning alerts system to which you refer.

When the IT systems are further developed and information regarding
the data you require becomes available I will write to you with an
update.

Should you have any further queries on this matter please do not
hesitate to contact me.
Yours sincerely






Cherry Butcher
