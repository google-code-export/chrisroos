Dear Chris,



Further to your request for information via our Webb site I can
confirm that it is the intention of TDC  to build a new pool next the
Ramsgate Sports Centre to replace the very old existing Pool at
Newington.

Currently there is no intention to close the old pool until the new
one has been built.

Thanet Leisureforce was in full agreement with the outcome of the
public consultation and is pushing for this project to be given high
priority and enable us as operators to improve the current service
available to the local community.

Work has been started on progressing this project which is currently
scheduled to be completed during 2011 and if you require any further
information you will need to contact the Leisure services team at TDC
who will be  project managing the work.

Thank you for your interest

Regards,

Steve Davis
