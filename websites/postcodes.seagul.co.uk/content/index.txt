%h1 UK Postcodes
%p.notice I'm removing this site because it's been superceded by the great work of the folks at <a href="http://ernestmarples.com/">Ernest Marples</a>.
%p This was basically a very poor version of ernestmarples, allowing you to retrieve the latitude/longitude of a UK Postcode outcode.  There's a little more information on the original idea on my <a href="http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2007-07-13-web-service-to-convert-uk-postcodes-outcode-to-latitude-and-longitude">blog</a>.
