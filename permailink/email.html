    <pre class="body">Chris,



Just came across your blog and the integration work that you've done
with Twitter and our website.  Unfortunately our terms and conditions
&lt;http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/contact/tandc/&gt;  prohibit the use of our
site in the manner you are using it and I have to ask you to stop, close
down and remove any software of yours that uses information from
nationalrial.co.uk.



Many thanks,
