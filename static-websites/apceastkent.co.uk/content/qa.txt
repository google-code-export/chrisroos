  %dt.question Tell me about APC Overnight and what it can do for me.
  %dd.answer APC is one of the fastest growing next day parcel delivery companies in the UK. We offer a professional, efficient service with guaranteed next day delivery throughout the UK.
  %dt.question Sounds good so far, tell me more...
  %dd.answer Within the APC there is a network of 120 agents strategically located throughout the UK. Each will have passed a series of stringent checks to ensure that they will be able to cope with the high standards expected of them. This comprehensive coverage allows us to collect and deliver to almost any address within the UK on a next day basis.
  %dt.question OK - so far so good, but how does my parcel get from A to B?
  %dd.answer Our overnight services are guaranteed delivery next day in four categories: before 09:00, before 10:00, before 12:00 and before 16:00. All you have to do is ring your local APC Depot, tell them the destination and the time you wish your parcel to arrive and hey presto! A courier will call and collect the parcel from you and take it back to the depot where it will be logged on the computer, labeled and then sent on its way to our Central Hub. That's how easy it is!
  %dt.question But will my parcel be safe?
  %dd.answer Of course - we ensure a high degree of personal attention on all consignments during loading and delivery; sorting is carried out manually, therefore the risk of damage, loss and mis-routing is drastically minimised - no worries!
