%h1 Public swimming pools
%p.notice I'm removing this placeholder site because I don't think it's adding any value to the web.
%p The intention was, and kinda still is, to create a site all about publicly accessible swimming pools (i.e. those that don't require you to be a member to use).  I was driven to start the project by the lack of a similar site that would serve my needs (there is "active places":http://activeplaces.co.uk but that's one of the least useful sites I've ever come across).
%p If you're in any way interested in this project then you might be interested in the "rewiredstate":http://rewiredstate.org "active places reloaded":http://rewiredstate.org/projects/active-places-reloaded hack that I participated in.
%p
