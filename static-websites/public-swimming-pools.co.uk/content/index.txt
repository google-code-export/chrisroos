%h1 Public swimming pools
%p.notice I'm removing this site because I don't think it's adding any value to the web.
%p The intention was, and kinda still is, to create a site all about publicly accessible swimming pools (i.e. those that don't require you to be a member to use).  I was driven to start the project by the lack of a similar site that would serve my needs (there is <a href="http://activeplaces.co.uk">active places</a> but that's one of the least useful sites I've ever come across).
%p If you're in any way interested in this project then you might be interested in the <a href="http://rewiredstate.org">rewiredstate</a> <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/projects/active-places-reloaded">active places reloaded</a> hack that I participated in, or my <a href="http://chrisroos.co.uk/blog/2008-03-31-another-project-public-swimming-pools-in-the-uk">original post</a> about the idea.
%p
